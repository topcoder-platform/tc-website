<p><strong>What brought you to TopCoder?</strong><br />
There are a lot of TopCoders in my school, and my friend is one of them. It is him who introduced TopCoder to me.</p>

<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month?</strong><br />
I feel really excited for that. I think I'm really lucky in this month.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
Reading and singing.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
In TopCoder I always try my best until the last second. And it is helpful to me in many areas of my life.</p>

<p><strong>What brought you to TopCoder?</strong><br />
I was interested in my code skills improvement. The TC business process has many unique features, like access to a big catalog of high quality components with full source code - so we can learn from winners; ability to communicate with qualified reviewers, PMs, and other community members; and, of course, all competitions are paid and open for anybody.</p>

<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month?</strong><br />
It is very exciting. There are so many qualified people in the TopCoder community and it is hard to win even a single contest.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
Reading books, wood crafting.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
I always try doing the best quality job in any area, but years at TopCoder components motivates and energizes me to perform nice things quickly. To be profitable at TopCoder we have to do not only the best solutions than others, but do it very fast too. So, now my regular life becomes much quicker, I could settle twice more daily tasks than previous.</p>

<p><strong>What brought you to TopCoder?</strong><br />
I'm Chinese. I see Topcoder in CCTV news at first time.</p>

<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month?</strong><br />
Good. This is my first milestone. I hope I will be Coder of the Year!</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
I have many hobbies. I like traveling, photography, the game of go.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
Enthusiasm! The TopCoder is an active company. I can see so many active coders together in TopCoder. That makes me so excited.<br />
    In other side, I can earn more money from the TopCoder.  It helps me to buy lens and games. That's the most that TopCoder helped me in the life.</p>

<p><strong>What brought you to Studio?</strong><br />
Interest and prize :)<br />
I'm a Java software engineer and like coding, but I also prefer graphic design, HCI(Home Computer Initiative); so Studio is one perfect place for me to make them besides my job.
</p>

<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Designer of the Month?</strong><br />
Surprised and pleasured. It's one big honor to be a studio member.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides Studio?</strong><br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga">Manga</a>, I'm one indeed
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku">Otaku</a>
</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at Studio that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
"Value Your Time", Many people have one bad habit -- dilatoriness, including me.<br />
We all like leave things to be done at the last minute, and waste a lot of time in start and process.<br />
At Studio, several times I've competed but uploaded my submission at the last minute.  This has caused me to lose contests due to submission failures.<br />
I saw somebody discuss this in the studio forum, and I laughed in my sleeve, because I'm same as them :) so I think we should "Value Your Time", value our time and throw dilatoriness down, quickly and efficiency work everything in our life.<br />
