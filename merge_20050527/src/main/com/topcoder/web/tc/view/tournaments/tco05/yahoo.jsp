Yahoo! is excited to sponsor the TopCoder Open and support the drive, intensity and innovative spirit of TopCoder members. We know a lot about you and we’re impressed (to say the least). We hope you’ll get to know a bit about us too.
<br><br>               
<span class="bodySubtitle">Why Yahoo!?</span>

<ul>
<li>Yahoo! has more than 125 employees with PhDs in topics that range from artificial intelligence and machine learning to data mining and information retrieval</li>
<li>Yahoo! has a strong tradition of using open source technologies... in fact the founder of PHP and core committers of FreeBSD are all Yahoos</li>
<li>Top bloggers like <A href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/" target="_blank">Jeremy Zawodny</A>, <A href="http://www.radwin.org/michael/blog/" target="_blank">Michael Radwin</A> and <A href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/" target="_blank">Russell Beattie</A> call Yahoo! home</li>
<li>Yahoo! has already hired more than 10 TopCoder members as part of our relationship with the competition and the two events we've sponsored</li>
</ul>

<span class="bodySubtitle">Did you know...</span>
<br><br>               
What started in 1994 as two Stanford Ph. D. students in a trailer, has quickly become the world’s most essential Internet service for consumers, as well as businesses. Over the past ten years, Yahoo! has established itself as the proven leader - reaching over 237 million unique users in 25 countries - but we never rest on our laurels.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Where do you fit in to the picture?</span>
<br><br>
We’re always looking ahead and need the smartest engineers in the world to drive our future. Relentless innovation, groundbreaking technology and worldwide influence are just a few of the reasons engineers love working at Yahoo!. (The free coffee, game room breaks and jeans-and-t-shirt atmosphere don’t hurt either.)
