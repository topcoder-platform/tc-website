		<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong><br/>
		TopCoder, Inc. will be conducting a contest for student representatives during the 2005 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge (TCCC05).
		As a result of this contest, one student representative will be awarded with a trip to attend the onsite finals of the TCCC05 in
		March 2005.</p>

		<p><strong>ELIGIBILITY</strong><br/>
		To be eligible for the contest, you must be:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>18 years of age or older; and </li>
			<li>A registered member of TopCoder in good standing.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Employees of TopCoder, Inc., their affiliated companies, advertising and promotion agencies and immediate family members of
		each are not eligible. Employees of any TCCC05 sponsoring companies are allowed to compete in the 2005 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge
		Student Representative Contest.  All federal, state and local laws and regulations apply. Void where prohibited. </p>

		<p><strong>TO ENTER</strong><br/>
		If not already a member, register for TopCoder electronically at <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/" target="_blank">www.topcoder.com</a>.  Once registered at TopCoder, send an email to
		MaryBeth Luce (<a href="mailto:mluce@topcoder.com?subject=TopCoder Student Reps">mluce@topcoder.com</a>) stating the following:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>You are willing to take the student representative position for your campus.</li>
			<li>Include the name of the college/university you will be representing.</li>
			<li>Include your TopCoder handle.</li>
			<li>Include how many posters you want to be sent.</li>
			<li>Include your mailing address.  This will be the address where the posters are sent.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>There is a limit of one (1) student representative at each college/university.  If you are the first person to
		respond from a particular college/university, you will be assigned as the student representative there and posters will be sent to you.</p>

		<p><strong>SELECTION OF WINNER</strong></br>
		The winner will be the student representative who has secured the most new registrants for TopCoder for their stated
		college/university and converted the greatest number of those new registrants into participants of the 2005 TopCoder
		Collegiate Challenge.  New registrants will be tracked from 9:00am ET on September 20, 2004 through 9:00am ET on January 11, 2005.
		In order for new registrants to be counted toward a student representative's total, each new registrant must state either the
		student representative's TopCoder handle or "Campus Poster" as the reason for registering at TopCoder.  No adjustments will be made
		for new registrants who do not state one of those two reasons upon registration.</p>

		<p><strong>PRIZE</strong><br/>
		One (1) student representative will be awarded a trip to attend the onsite finals of the 2005 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge.
		TopCoder will provide travel arrangements for winning student representative, up to a cost of $1,000. (That is, if the airfare
		is greater than $1,000, the student representative will be responsible for the difference between the cost of the airfare and
		$1,000.) TopCoder will provide ground transportation to and from the airport, as well as hotel accommodations and certain meals
		for the student representative. All other expenses are the responsibility of the student representative. TopCoder will not
		provide travel or lodging accommodations for a guest to accompany the student representative to the 2005 TopCoder Collegiate
		Challenge.  The winner accepts responsibility for all federal, state, and local taxes and fees in connection with the prize.</p>
