First, some old business.  The results from the third round of the CDDC Appeals (the "Finals") are in. The winners for design (for the DataView Decorator) were:
<br/><br/>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" class="bodyText">
<tr><td><b>Handle</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="119676" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="152342" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="278342" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
</table>
<br/><br/>
And for development, for the Bread Crumb Trail:
<br/><br/>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" class="bodyText">
<tr><td><b>Handle</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="7548200" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="10098406" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="14926554" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
</table>
<br/><br/>
<h1>The winners, Take 1</h1>
Before the Algorithm System Test results were in, Mike Lydon from TopCoder came out to line up the Component Development finalists, and to announce the winner.  But, the scoreboard was showing the Design finalists instead of the Development Finalists.  When this was pointed out, he ran backstage, then back out again, and said there was a problem with the scoreboard, and that they would try to take a few mintues to fix it.  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=251184">"Someone"</a> shouted "Is there an engineer in the house?" Sadly, this did not have its intended uproarious effect. Oh well.
<br/><br/>
After a while, Mike came back out with the microphone and the results.
<br/><br/>
<h1>Once more, with feeling</h1>
In development, the final placements were:
<br/><br/>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" class="bodyText">
<tr><td><b>Handle</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="7548200" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="299979" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="10098406" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="14926554" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="7210680" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="15664457" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="15832159" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="10526732" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
</table>
<br/><br/>
Overall, taking their wagers into account, the Final CDDC design order was:
<br/><br/>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" class="bodyText">
<tr><td><b>Handle</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="119676" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="293874" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="278342" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="152342" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="11797255" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="150498" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="15891862" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
<tr><td><tc-webtag:handle coderId="252022" darkBG="true" /></td></tr>
</table>
<br/><br/>
This means that <tc-webtag:handle coderId="119676" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7548200" darkBG="true" /> are the TopCoder Open 2006 Design and
Development champions! When he found out, he was on the phone with his wife Stephanie -- who "didn't say
anything, she was just screaming."
<br/><br/>
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="119676" darkBG="true" /> told me during the afternoon "Next Generation" session that
didn't know if he'd be able to pull it off, and felt that
had he known he had done so well on his second component, he would definitely had wagered differently.
In the end, the wagers really <u>did</u> make a difference for the final design placements. If <tc-webtag:handle coderId="119676" darkBG="true" /> had wagered 
more evenly over all 3 components, and second-place design finalist <tc-webtag:handle coderId="293874" darkBG="true" /> had put a larger wager into his first-place win
in the Relation component, the outcome might've been different.
<br/><br/>
Today, I had the pleasure of meeting <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7548200" darkBG="true" />, when he came up to me and introduced himself (he was the first one
to say that he didn't recognize me from my profile picture!)  I hadn't met him previously this week, so I'm glad I got 
a chance to meet him before the finalists were announced.  He was shocked that he had won, since he had never done a ASP.NET
component before!  The same thing with regard to the wagering happened in development as design -- if the wagering had been
different, it's possible that second-place development finalist <tc-webtag:handle coderId="299979" darkBG="true" /> might've pulled out a victory.

<font size="1">I actually wrote much of this blog entry (except for the algorithms) during the time
that Mike Lydon was backstage.  I predicted <tc-webtag:handle coderId="119676" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7548200" darkBG="true" /> had won, merely based on their three scores.
</font>
<br/><br/>
<h1>Algorithms</h1>
After an exciting coding and challenge phase, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10574855" darkBG="true" /> emerged as the TCO 2006 Algorithms Champion.  (I could say
"I told ya so", but since I hadn't predicted it, I can't.)  Check out <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8416646" darkBG="true" />'s blog for the gory details on the round itself.  
At the Press Conference, Jim McKeown for TopCoder asked the newly named champion 
"Did you ever imaging winning the TCO? (Well, of course you did!) What was the criticial decision that you made to 
lead you to victory?"  <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10574855" darkBG="true" />'s simple, direct, and correct answer was, "Code the correct solution to the hard problem!"  Indeed,
this was one of the deciding factors in his victory over <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" darkBG="true" /> -- getting the 1000-point problem correct.
<br/><br/>
Congratulations to all the winners!!!
<br/><br/>
<h1>Wrap-up and Administrivia</h1>
After the winners were announced, there was a "Media Hour" (really, a "Media 15-minutes") during which each
champion was interviewed and the local, and some national, media were able to participate as well.
<br/><br/>
In case you were wondering what I look like while I write, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="119676" darkBG="true" /> took this picture of me:
<br/><br/>
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/dplass-13-01.jpg" /></div>
<br/><br/>
Judging from my completely receeded hairline, I'd say it's time for a new member photo!  If anybody wants to be in touch other than in the forums and arena,
you can email me at my handle at yahoo.com.
<br/><br/>
I'd like to thank all the TopCoder staff for all their hard work, help and support this week; there are too many here to mention, but I would be remiss to not name Jessie, Tricia, Kevin, Mess, Faxman, dok, and of course
<h1>Nick... Nick... Nick...</h1>
"Thank yous" also go out to all those who gave
feedback in person and on the forums, to both me and my fellow bloggers: in <a href="http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=510766">alphabetical order</a>, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="21471147" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="21518515" darkBG="true" />, and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8416646" darkBG="true" />.  Blogging the TCO, and reading the blogs, really enhances the whole TopCoder experience, whether algorithms, design, development, or the cultural aspects of the event.
<br/><br/>
If y'all can't tell, I had an absolute blast both experiencing and blogging the event that is the TopCoder Open.  
I said to my wife Sue (only about 12 more hours baby!) that this was the opportunity
of a lifetime, to which she said "Hopefully not!"  Yeah! That's the spirit!  Hopefully I'll see you all next year
as a <b>competitor</b> in the TCO 2007, wherever (and whenever) that may be!
<br/><br/>
As they say, "Good luck in the arena"<br/>

P.S. Even though I won't be eligible, you can be sure I'll be following the TopCoder Collegiate Challenge
in November 2006 in sunny San Diego California.  See you there!
