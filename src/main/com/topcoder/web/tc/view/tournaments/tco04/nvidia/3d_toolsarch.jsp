                    <p class=pageTitle>3D TOOLS ARCHITECT #556817</p>
                    
                    <p>As a member of the nVidia architecture team (the hottest team in 3D graphics!) you will be developing 
                    Architectural models of and development and analysis tools for some of the most complex GPUs / ASICs in 
                    the world. In this capacity, the architect will be expected to become familiar with NVIDIA current 
                    architecture, algorithms, products, and development methodologies, and understand current and developing 
                    PC architectures. In this key role, you will be instrumental in analysis and validation of requirements 
                    for 3D graphics architectures and verification of their implementation in hardware. </p>
                    
                    <p>Responsibilities include the design, development and support of tools and environments for:</p>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Capturing and analyzing application workloads at various levels to form requirements and tradeoffs for chips in development</li>
						<li>Analyzing model behavior on application workloads against its goals and actual hardware implementation </li>
						<li>Building reference models for new architectures </li>
						<li>Building reference prototype driver implementations for new architectures </li>
					</ul>

					<p>Required Skills:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>BS, MS or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, or 
						related field, with 3+ yrs of relevant industry experience. For senior positions, 
						an advanced degree and 8+ years industry experience. (Multiple Junior and Senior 
						positions available.)</li>
						<li>3D Graphics Application or driver development experience</li>
						<li>Excellent knowledge of at least one of OpenGL or D3D </li>
						<li>Exceptional C and C++, programming, scripting, system debugging, </li>
						<li>Knowledge of PC and graphics architectures. </li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Desired Skills: Candidates should have experience in several of the areas below</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Experience with kernel development and debug on Windows and/or Linux,</li>
						<li>Experience with systems and graphics performance analysis </li>
						<li>Familiarity image processing tools and techniques </li>
						<li>Exceptional C, C++, and object oriented programming skills.</li>
