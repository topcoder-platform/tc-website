<br><br>
The 2005 TopCoder Open ("TCO") Component Design and Development Competition ("CDDC") will take place between June 29 and October 14, 2005.  It will consist of two competitions - the design competition and the development competition.  Each competition will consist of five (5) weeks of online competition and one (1) onsite final round, being the Championship round.  The prize purse for this tournament is $75,000 in cash, with $46,500 being awarded for the design competition and $28,500 for the development competition.  The eight (8) competitors in each competition with the highest cumulative placement scores after the online rounds of competition will advance to the onsite Championship round, being held at the Marriott in Santa Clara, CA, USA on October 12, 13 and 14, 2005.

<a href="#top"><img src="/i/navigation/back_to_top.gif" alt="back to top" width="83" height="23" border="0" align="right"></a>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Eligibility</span>
<br><br>
TopCoder members meeting the following eligibility criteria are eligible to compete in the CDDC: 
<ul>
<li>Must be at least 18 years of age as of June 29, 2005; AND</li>
<li>If not a US resident, must be living in, and participating from, your country of residence; AND</li>
<li>Must not have been permanently suspended from participating in TopCoder Component projects.</li>
</ul>
TopCoder members who are 18 years of age or older as of June 28, 2005 are eligible to win cash prizes, unless otherwise prohibited. The TopCoder Open is void in the Quebec province of Canada, and elsewhere where prohibited by applicable law. Cash prizes will not be paid to residents of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria.
<br><br>
Those members who are eligible to compete in both the Algorithm Competition of the TCO and in the CDDC will be permitted to participate in both, and advance to the finals in both.  In addition, members will be allowed to compete in both the design and development competitions of the TCO.  However, if one member participates in both the design and development competitions AND qualifies as one of the finalists in each, then the member will only be permitted to advance to the Championship round in one of the competitions.  The following criteria will be used to determine to which competition the member will advance:
<ol>
<li>The member will advance to the competition in which he/she achieved a higher cumulative score.</li>
<li>If the member's cumulative placement score is the same for both competitions, then the member will choose the competition in which he/she will compete.</li>
</ol>
Employees of TopCoder, Inc. and of all official tournament sponsors, regardless of commitment date as sponsor, including any companies involved in the production (including prize suppliers), implementation and distribution of this tournament and their advertising or promotion agencies, parent companies, service providers, agents, officers, subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other persons or entities directly associated with the tournament and members of the immediate families and/or persons living in the same household as such persons, are ineligible to enter the tournament.  If a competitor's employer signs up as an official sponsor of the tournament on or after June 13, 2005, then that competitor will be disqualified from participating further in the tournament.  TopCoder members who are performing internships for any official tournament sponsor between June 13 and October 14, 2005 are also ineligible to compete.

<span class="bodySubtitle">Placement Scoring</span>
<br><br>
Scoring in the CDDC is determined based on the placement for each submission. Placement is determined based on the score awarded for a particular component. For example, if 3 submissions were received for a component and the scores were 93, 89, and 71, the member receiving the score of 93 would be in 1st place and would receive 10 points.  Note that only those registered for the tournament are considered when determining place and placement points. In order to receive placement points, a submission must pass the minimum component score of 70. Placement scoring is as follows: 
<br /><br />
<table width="300" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2" class="sidebarBox">
   <tr>
      <td class="sidebarText" align=center>
      1st Place - 10 Points<br />
      2nd Place - 7 Points<br />
      3rd Place - 5 points<br />
      4th Place - 4 Points<br />
      5th Place - 0 Points
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>
<br /><br />
The placement points outlined are for both Level One and Level Two components.

<span class="bodySubtitle">Schedule</span>
<br><br>
Both the design and development competitions will have five (5) weeks of online competition and one (1) onsite Championship round.  Each contestant participating in an online round must submit his/her design and/or development submission for components by the submission deadline as scheduled.  TopCoder members from around the world may be participating in the online rounds, but all start times, registration deadlines and submission deadlines will be communicated as Eastern Daylight Time, so contestants in different time zones must adjust accordingly.

<span class="bodySubtitle">Scoring and Advancing</span>
<br><br>
During each week of competition, eligible competitors can submit design and development solutions for at least one eligible component by the submission deadline.  Submissions will be scored by the TopCoder Review Boards and will be subject to final review and appeal in the same manner as standard component design and development submissions.  Scoring of each submission by the TopCoder Review Boards is based on the criteria outlined in the <A href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=dev&d2=devReviewSample">Development Review Scorecard</A> for the Development Contest or the criteria outlined in the <A href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=dev&d2=desReviewSample">Design Review Scorecard</A> for the Design Contest.    Note that the scorecards to be used for the CDDC are the ones that are in effect as of June 29, 2005. <strong>ALL SUBMISSIONS MUST BE RECEIVED ACCORDING TO THE SUBMISSION DEADLINE TO BE CONSIDERED A VIABLE ENTRY.  THERE WILL BE NO EXCEPTIONS.</strong>  There will be no elimination of contestants during the online competition.
<br><br>
Up to the four (4) highest individual placement scores that each contestant receives for his/her submissions throughout the five (5) weeks of competition will be added together for a cumulative placement score.  The eight (8) competitors in each competition with the highest cumulative positive (i.e., greater than zero) placement score will advance to the onsite Championship round.  
<br><br>
In the event of a tie of cumulative placement score among the advancers to the Championship round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:
<ol>
<li>Highest cumulative component score of the lesser number of components used to develop the cumulative placement score for the tied competitors.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then the highest individual component score of the lesser number of components used to develop the cumulative placement score for the tied competitors.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then all tied contestants will advance to the online Championship round.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Example:</strong><br>
Contestant #1 submits three components in the design competition, earning the following component and placement scores:
<br><br>
Component #1 - score 88.45; placement 2; placement score 7<br>
Component #2 - score 76.33; placement 3; placement score 5<br>
Component #3 - score 82.89; placement 3; placement score 5
<br><br>
Cumulative placement score: 7 + 5 + 5 = 17
<br><br>
Contestant #2 submits two components in the design competition, earning the following component and placement scores:
<br><br>
Component #1 - score 92.56; placement 1; placement score 10<br>
Component #2 - score 75.83; placement 2; placement score 7
<br><br>
Cumulative placement score: 10 + 7 = 17
<br><br>
To determine who advances to Championship round, look at the highest cumulative component score of the lesser number of components used to develop the cumulative placement score for the tied competitors.
<br><br>
Contestant #1: 88.45 + 82.89 = 171.34<br>
Contestant #2: 92.56 + 75.83 = 168.39
<br><br>
Contestant #1 would advance to the Championship round.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Championship Round</span>
<br><br>
The eight (8) advancers in each competition from the five (5) weeks of online competition will travel to the Santa Clara Marriott on Tuesday, October 11, 2005 to compete in the final competitive stage of the tournament being held on Wednesday, October 12, 2005.  All contestants must arrive at the Santa Clara Marriott no later than 4:00 PM PDT on Tuesday, October 11, 2005.  All contestants must confirm their attendance at the onsite Championship Round no later than 5:00 PM EDT on Monday, August 22, 2005 by emailing <A href="mailto:jdamato@topcoder.com&subject=TCO05 Attendance">jdamato@topcoder.com</A>.  That is, contestants must have acquired any necessary travel visas and know for certain that they can travel to the US by that date and time.  If a contestant is unable to attend the onsite round, he/she will forfeit his/her eligibility to receive any prizes awarded to onsite finalists, and his/her spot in the tournament will be given to the competitor with the next highest positive (i.e., greater than zero) cumulative placement score from the online competition.  
<br><br>
TopCoder will provide travel arrangements for each competitor up to a cost of $1,000 per person.  (That is, if a contestant's airfare is greater than $1,000, the difference between the cost of the airfare and $1,000 will be deducted from the contestant's total TCO prize money won.  If the contestant's total TCO prize money is not sufficient to cover the additional costs, they will be subtracted from the contestant's overall TCO winnings.)  TopCoder will also provide ground transportation to and from the airport, as well as hotel accommodations and certain meals for each contestant.  All other expenses are the responsibility of the contestant.  TopCoder will not provide travel or lodging accommodations for competitor guests at the 2005 TCO.
<br><br>
Online portion of Championship Round:  There will be an online portion of the Championship Round, which will follow the normal component design/development process (up to and including final review).  To ensure that the submitters receive no advantage from the Review Board, the reviews will only include required items.  No comments or recommendations will be included.
<br><br>
Onsite portion of Championship Round:  There will also be an onsite portion of the Championship Round.  During the onsite Championship Round, competitors will need to implement an enhancement to their development/design submission from the online portion of the Championship Round.  Competitors will be given a choice of three (3) enhancements that they can implement, however only one (1) will be scored.  The onsite portion of the Championship Round will last six (6) hours, from 10:00AM to 4:00PM on Wednesday, October 12, 2005.  There will be a mandatory 30-minute break from 12:00 - 12:30PM.  All competitors must step away from their workstations during the 30-minute break.  The onsite Review Board will review the submitted enhancements on Thursday, October 13, 2005.  There will be a one and a half (1.5) hour online appeals phase on Friday, October 14, 2005, after which the final scoring will be performed.  Competitors will not see the review scorecards until the appeals phase starts.  Appeals will not be responded to until the appeals phase is over.
<br><br>
The Championship Round will include eight (8) members in each competition.  Two winners will be crowned, one Design Champion and one Development Champion.  Each champion will be the competitor who receives the highest score for his/her enhancement during the onsite portion of the Championship Round.  
<br><br>
Championship Tiebreaker:  In the event of a tie in the Championship Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order):
<ol>
<li>By cumulative placement score as of the end of the five (5) weeks of online competition (highest cumulative placement score wins).</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then by highest cumulative component score of the lesser number of components used to develop the cumulative placement score for the tied competitors.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then the prize money will be distributed equally among the tied members.</li>
</ol>
