            <span class="bodySubtitle">Official Contest Rules - 2006 TopCoder&#174; Open Logo Design Contest</span><br><br>
<b>NO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN.  VOID WHERE PROHIBITED.</b>
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">OVERVIEW</span><br>
TopCoder, Inc. will be conducting a contest for members prior to the 2006 TopCoder Open (TCO06).  As a result of this contest, one logo will be selected as the base for the tournament logo for the TCO06.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">ELIGIBILITY</span><br>
To be eligible for the contest, you must be:
<ul>
<li>18 years of age or older; and 
<li>A registered member of TopCoder in good standing.
</ul>
Employees of TopCoder, Inc., their affiliated companies, advertising and promotion agencies and immediate family members of each are not eligible. Employees of any TCO06 sponsoring companies are allowed to compete in the 2006 TopCoder Open Logo Design Contest.  All federal, state and local laws and regulations apply. Void where prohibited. 
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">TO ENTER</span><br>
If not already a member, register for TopCoder electronically <a href="/Registration">here</a>.   Once registered at TopCoder, submit designs using the submission functionality <A href="/tc?module=TCO06LogoTerms">here</A>.  Logos must be submitted by 5:00pm EDT on Friday, November 18, 2005.  Submissions received after that time or by any other method will not be considered.
<br><br>
<span class="bigRed">TopCoder will accept the first three (3) designs submitted by each registrant.</span>    
<br><br>
The logo must adhere to the following strict guidelines*.  Any deviation from these guidelines will result in disqualification of a design.  That design WILL count as one of your three submissions.
<ul>
<li><b>Content:</b>
   <ul>
   <li>The logo <span class="bigRed">MUST</span> include the title of the tournament: "2006 TopCoder Open"</li>
   <li>"TopCoder" <span class="bigRed">MUST</span> be written as one word with (roughly) equal distance between each letter</li>
   <li>"TopCoder" <span class="bigRed">MUST</span> be written as either "TopCoder" or "TOPCODER"</li>
   <li>"Open" <span class="bigRed">MUST</span> be written as either "Open" or "OPEN"</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li><b>File format:</b> Your submission <span class="bigRed">MUST</span> be a .GIF, .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP</li>
<li><b>Image size:</b> Your submissions should be 300 pixels wide by Y pixels high. If one of your submissions is not 300 pixels wide and Y pixels high, we will shrink/expand it to the correct size.</li>
<li><b>Colors:</b>
   <ul>
   <li>The main colors for the TCO06 will be [] and [], and your submission <span class="bigRed">MUST</span> use these colors.  White, black and grays can be used as compliments.  Other colors can be used, but may detract from the "focus" of the two required colors.</li>
   <li>While gradients (gradual color changes) may look appealing in your logo, they can often be a problem in print (t-shirts, tournament programs) and might keep your submission from being considered as a finalist.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Font:</b>  All fonts are acceptable with the exception of Bank Gothic or anything in the Bank Gothic family.</li>
<li><b>Theme:</b>  There is no formally stated theme for the TCO06 Logo Design Contest.  This time, we wanted to give designers the freedom to be as creative as they want.</li>
</ul>
*Please allow 24 hours to receive feedback as to whether your design is disqualified for not adhering to the guidelines.  If you submit all three (3) designs at once and any are disqualified for not adhering to the guidelines, you will not be allowed to submit additional designs.  
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">SELECTION OF WINNER</span><br>
Up to ten (10) designs will be chosen by TopCoder, and put in front of the TopCoder community for a vote.  The voting will begin at 10:00am EDT on Wednesday, November 23 and will end at 5:00pm EDT on Wednesday, November 30, 2005.  TopCoder will use the Schulze Method to determine the winner based on the voting by the TopCoder community.  For an explanation of the Schulze method, see <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method">here</A>. In the event of a tie when voting is complete, TopCoder will choose between the tied submissions.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">PRIZE</span><br>
The contest will award cash prizes totaling $5,000 to up to 5 competitors.  Any and all applicable taxes on prizes are the sole responsibility of the prizewinner.  Prizes will be distributed as follows:
