            <h3>Overview of the Tournament</h3>
            <p>The 2008 TopCoder Open Studio Design Competition ("SDC") will take place between January 14 and May 15, 2008, and is part of the 2008 TopCoder Open ("Tournament"). It will consist of eight (8) weeks of online competition and three (3) onsite final rounds, being the Championship Rounds. The prize purse for the SDC is $45,000 in cash. The twelve (12) competitors with the highest cumulative placement scores at the conclusion of the online rounds of competition will advance to the onsite Championship Rounds, to be held at the Mirage Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA on May 12 - 15, 2008.</p>
            
            <a name="eligibility"></a>
            <h3>Eligibility</h3>
            <p>TopCoder Studio members meeting the following criteria are eligible to compete in the SDC:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Must be at least 18 years of age as of January 14, 2008; AND</li>
                <li>If not a US resident, must be living in, and participating from, your country of residence; AND</li>
                <li>Must currently be eligible for participation in TopCoder Studio projects (i.e. not suspended from TopCoder); AND</li>
                <li>Must not be a resident of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The SDC is void in the Quebec province of Canada and elsewhere where prohibited by applicable law.</p>
            <p>Employees of TopCoder, Inc. and of all Tournament sponsors, regardless of commitment date as sponsor, including any companies involved in the production (including prize suppliers), implementation and distribution of the SDC or the Tournament and their advertising or promotion agencies, parent companies, service providers, agents, officers, subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other persons or entities directly associated with the SDC or the Tournament and members of the immediate families and/or persons living in the same household as such persons, are ineligible to participate in the SDC. If a competitor's employer signs up as a sponsor of the Tournament on or after January 14, 2008, then that competitor will be disqualified from participating further in the Tournament. TopCoder Studio members who are performing internships for any Tournament sponsor between January 14 and May 15, 2008 are also ineligible to participate.</p>
            <p>Those members who are eligible to compete in any of the four Tournament competitions will be permitted to participate in any/all of them online. However, in the event a competitor becomes a finalist in more than one competition and the onsite competition times overlap, the competitor must choose only one competition in which to participate as a finalist by March 26, 2008.</p>
            <p>In the event that a competitor is disqualified from any round, no other competitors will be added in his/her place.  The only exception to this is advancement to Onsite Competition Round 1.</p>
            
            <a name="registration"></a>
            <h3>Registration</h3>
            <p>Registration for the SDC will open at 9:00 AM EST on Monday, January 14, 2008, and will close at 5:00 PM EST on Monday, March 3, 2008. In order to be eligible to compete in the SDC, competitors must register separately for the SDC. There is no limit to the number of competitors in the SDC; however each competitor may only register once.</p>
            
            <a name="placement"></a>
            <h3>Placement Scoring</h3>
            <p>Studio contests that are eligible for points towards the SDC will be identified on the Studio website starting the week of January 14, 2008. Scoring in the SDC is determined by the placement of the top five (5) submissions in each eligible contest by an SDC competitor.</p>
            <p>A competitor's score is determined by the placement of each competitor's submissions. The placement of the competitor's submissions is determined by the ranking of the design.</p>
            <p>Competitors must be registered for the SDC to be eligible for SDC placement points. Placement points will be awarded to SDC competitors in Studio contests that are part of the online SDC competition as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1st Place - 17 points</li>
                <li>2nd Place - 15 points</li>
                <li>3rd Place - 13 points</li>
                <li>4th Place - 10 points</li>
                <li>5th Place - 7 points</li>
                <li>6th Place (and lower) - 0 points</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Open Competition Explanation</h3>
            <p>Both Studio members who have not registered for the SDC and SDC-registered competitors will be allowed to enter any Studio design contest. Only SDC-registered competitors will earn placement points towards their SDC-ranking. Studio members who are not registered for the SDC will still earn traditional placement and prizes. Because of the mixed competitor pool, an example of Tournament placement and points is provided in the following table.</p>

            <h3>Scoring and Advancing</h3>
            <p>During the eight (8) weeks of online competition, eligible competitors can submit designs for as many contests as they like. After the submission phase for the contest is over, submissions will be screened against the Spec Doc by the Contest Administrator and either passed or failed depending on whether all of the requirements of the Spec Doc are met.</p>
            <p>ALL SUBMISSIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE SUBMISSION DEADLINE TO BE CONSIDERED A VIABLE ENTRY. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS. There is no elimination of competitors during the online competition.</p>
            <p>After the submission phase for a contest is over, the qualifying submissions will be ranked by TopCoder.</p>
            <p>Up to the six (6) highest individual placement scores that each competitor receives for his/her submissions throughout the eight (8) weeks of competition will be added together for a cumulative placement score. A maximum of twelve (12) competitors with the highest cumulative placement scores greater than zero will advance to the onsite Championship Rounds.</p>
            <p>Example:<br />
            Competitor enters three (3) SDC eligible contests during the online competition, earning the following placement scores:<br />
            Contest #1 - placement 2; placement score 15<br />
            Contest #2 - placement 3; placement score 13<br />
            Contest #3 - placement 3; placement score 13<br />
            Cumulative placement score: 15 + 13 + 13 = 41</p>
            <p>In the event of a tie of cumulative placement score among the advancers to the Championship Rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The competitor who has the most higher-placed submissions among those submissions used to develop the cumulative placement score for the tied competitors shall advance.</li>
                <li>If a tie still remains, then the tied competitors will enter into a Rapid Design Contest (see below) and the winner shall advance.</li>
                <li>If a tie still remains, then all tied competitors will advance to the onsite Championship Rounds.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The Rapid Design Contest will only include the competitors who are tied as stated above. This contest will consist of designing a mock (graphical representation) of a fictitious web site's main page. The tied finalists will only be allowed to submit one design for this contest. The designs must pass the standard Studio screening process to be accepted. Once submissions are received, they will be presented to the TopCoder Studio members for an online vote. The winner of the Rapid Design Contest will be chosen based on who wins the community vote. The winner will advance to the onsite finals. THE RESULTS OF THE VOTE AND CHOICE OF THE WINNER ARE FINAL.</p>
            <p>The schedule for the Rapid Design Contest is as follows:</p>
            <p>Rapid Design Contest Spec Doc posted and Submission Phase begins: Noon EDT (UTC/GMT -4) March 18, 2007<br />
            Submission Phase ends:  Noon EDT (UTC/GMT -4), March 19, 2008<br />
            Voting Phase: March 19 - March 21, 2007<br />
            Winner Announced: March 21, 2007</p>
            
            <h3>Championship Rounds</h3>
            <p>For example:<br />
            Competitor #1 submits work in 7 SDC competitions, earning the following placement scores:<br />
            Submission #1 -  placement 2; placement score 15<br />
            Submission #2 - placement 6; placement score 0<br />
            Submission #3 - placement 3; placement score 13<br />
            Submission #4 - placement 1; placement score 17<br />
            Submission #5 - placement 2; placement score 15<br />
            Submission #6 - placement 7; placement score 0<br />
            Submission #7 - placement 5; placement score 7</p>
            <p>Competitor #1's cumulative placement score:<br />
            15 + 0 + 13 + 17 + 15 + 0 + 7 = 67</p>
            <p>Competitor #2 submits work in 5 SDC competitions, earning the following review and placement scores:<br />
            Submission #1 - placement 2; placement score 15<br />
            Submission #2 - placement 4; placement score 10<br />
            Submission #3 - placement 5; placement score 7<br />
            Submission #4 - placement 2; placement score 15<br />
            Submission #5 - placement 4; placement score 10<br />
            Submission #6 - placement 4; placement score 10</p>
            <p>Competitor #2's cumulative placement score:<br />
            15 + 10 + 7 + 15 + 10 + 10 = 67</p>
            <p>To break the tie and determine who advances to Championship rounds, the Competitors' placements will be compared to determine who has the most higher-placed submissions among those submissions used to develop the cumulative placement score.</p>
            <p>Competitor #1: Number of 1st Places = 1<br />
            Competitor #2: Number of 1st Places = 0</p>
            <p>In this example, Competitor #1 would advance to the Championship Rounds.</p>

            <p>TopCoder will issue visa invitation letters at the request of international competitors who require one to obtain a travel visa to enter the United States. All competitors who have earned Tournament SDC placement points by February 22, 2008 will receive a request form to fill out if they require a letter. As soon as a competitor fills out the form in its entirety and returns it to TopCoder, the visa letter will be mailed. Competitors have until 5:00 PM EDT (GMT/UTC -4) on Wednesday, March 12, 2008 to request a letter. Visas can take a significant amount of time to obtain in certain countries; therefore, for those competitors who need a letter, it is in their best interest to request one well before the deadline. The cost of obtaining a visa is the sole responsibility of the competitor. See more information about <a target="_blank" href="/wiki/display/tc/Getting+your+Visa+and+Getting+it+Early">travel visas</a>.</p>
            <h4>Travel Details</h4>
            <p>TopCoder will provide air travel arrangements for each competitor. The flight will be reserved and paid for by TopCoder and will be for arrival on May 11, 2008 and departure on May 15, 16 or 17, 2008, whichever is most cost-effective. At TopCoder's sole discretion, TopCoder will pay for each competitor's airfare up to $1,500, but reserves the right to make exceptions to the maximum amount based on individual circumstances.  If a Competitor wishes to take a flight other than the one provided by TopCoder and/or wishes to stay in a hotel other than the Mirage or wishes to stay additional nights at the Mirage or another hotel, the Competitor shall be responsible for the entire cost of such a deviation from the accommodations and travel arrangements provided by TopCoder.  In addition, Competitor agrees to reimburse TopCoder for any costs, penalties, fines or fees incurred by TopCoder as a result of such a deviation.</p>
            <p>Ground transportation to and from McCarran International Airport will be provided for each competitor by TopCoder, as well as hotel accommodations and certain meals. All other expenses are the responsibility of the competitor. TopCoder will not provide travel or lodging accommodations for any guests of a competitor.</p>
            
            <h3>Onsite Championship Rounds</h3>
            <p>During each Championship Round, each competitor will compete on the same design challenge, which will be announced 15 minutes before the beginning of the round. Competitors will receive competition documentation at this time.</p>
            <p>Competitors will have the following timeframes to complete and submit their final designs:<br />
            Round 1: Three (3) hours<br />
            Round 2: Two and one half (2.5) hours<br />
            Round 3: Two (2) hours</p>
            <p>Finalists must use the workstation provided by TopCoder during the Championship Rounds. This workstation will contain the following:</p>

            <p>The winner of the SDC will be determined based on the placement scores received for each Championship Round (rounding down to three (3) decimal places). Placement scores will be awarded by TopCoder for each Championship Round. Round weights and placement scores are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Round 1: Weight for Final Score = 50%</li>
                <li>Round 2: Weight for Final Score = 25%</li>
                <li>Round 3: Weight for Final Score = 25%</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Placement Scoring for All Championship Rounds:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>11th Place - 0 points</li>
                <li>12th Place -  0 points</li>
            </ul>
