        <p><span class="bodySubtitle">When to start the Competition Round</span><br />
TopCoder members must register for the competition round. Registration may occur at any time during the two week competition round. All competitors who have registered for the competition round will immediately be given access to the competition problem statement for that round. The next competition round will begin on January 20, 2010 at 13:00 GMT/UTC -5 which is the earliest time that any member will be given access to the problem statement.         <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Upon Entering a Marathon Match</span><br />
			All competitors registered for a specific Marathon Match will see a Submit option for that event. Clicking the Submit link will take you to a page that will allow you to paste in a solution, select the proper language and either submit (for compilation and testing) or save your code. When the Submit button is selected, the code will be immediately compiled. Any compilation messages or errors will be shown in the Messages Area. If the compilation was successful, the submission will then be placed on a queue for automated testing. Example test cases will not be tested. When your submission has been processed, you will receive an email indicating such and your place in the standings will be adjusted accordingly. During the submission phase, overall ranking and provisional score are the only pieces of information that will be made available. A given competitor will only be allowed to submit once every 2 hours. Additionally, if a competitor has a pending submission on the testing queue it must finish testing before they may submit again.</p>

			<p>Clicking the Test Examples button will immediately compile and place your submission on a queue for automated testing of just the example test cases. Detailed feedback will be made available when the tests are complete, including processing time, score, and any output from the program. Competitors may submit test examples once every 15 minutes. The competitor's rank and overall score will not be updated.</p>

        <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Prizes</span><br />
        There will be up to $3000 in total prize money awarded to the five (5) highest scoring members who are citizens of the United States.
