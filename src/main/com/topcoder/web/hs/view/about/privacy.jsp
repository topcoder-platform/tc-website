                        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

                        <p>Because we value privacy as much as we value programmers, TopCoder is committed to protecting the privacy of our
                        users.  We want to provide a safe, secure user experience.  We will use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that the
                        information you submit to us remains private.  Your personal information is immediately transferred from our web
                        server to behind our firewall, where it remains isolated from a direct connection to the Internet.</p>

                        <p>Our security and Privacy Commitment are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary.  However, you should
                        understand that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.  The information that you submit to us is used only for
                        the purposes as set forth herein, as required by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is legally required
                        to protect our rights.  We will not use your personal information for any other purpose other than as set out here
                        without first obtaining your permission.  The following reflects our commitment to you.</p>

                        <p><strong>Information About All TopCoder Visitors</strong><br>
                        We gather information about all of our users collectively, including (a) what area users visit most frequently, (b) their
                        Internet domain and their computer's IP address, (c) the type of browser and operating system they use and (d) if the
                        user linked to our Web site from another Web site, the address of that other Web site.  This information does not in any
                        way personally identify a user; we only use this data anonymously and in the aggregate.  We use this information to
                        analyze trends and statistics to help us improve our services, plan site enhancements and measure overall site
                        effectiveness.  From time to time we may reveal general, anonymous, aggregated statistical information about our site,
                        services and users, such as the number of visits and users and what site features they use.</p>

                        <p><strong>Information About You Specifically</strong><br>
                        If you choose to register as a member in order to participate in TopCoder High School competitions, you will provide us
                        with additional information about yourself, including name, email address and high school. If you are a winner in a
                        competition and / or tournament, we may also request your address and date of birth.  In addition, if you are a U.S.
                        person (including U.S resident aliens), we will request your social security number (or taxpayer identification
                        number) on IRS form W-9.  If you are a winner, and you are not a U.S person, we will request a Certificate of Foreign
                        Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding on IRS form W-8BEN.  We use this information to verify
                        your eligibility to participate in specific tournaments, and to contact you and properly notify the IRS should you be a
                        winner.  From time to time, we may use the contact information to alert members of new competitions and communicate
                        news, events and reminders.  If you do not want to be alerted of any of these items, you can send us an e-mail at
                        <a href="mailto:service@topcoder.com">service@topcoder.com</a> asking to be removed as a member of TopCoder High
                        School.  During competition, users participating will be shown and identified only by their handles, which are their
                        public login names.  A TopCoder High School member's handle, rating, date registered, winnings to date, skill set, and
                        personal quote will be publicly available to any participants of the TopCoder High School web site and competition
                        applications.</p>

                        <p>Spectators are allowed to view the competition by simply logging into the competition applet with their TopCoder
                        High School handle.  Competition participants must be members and must login to prove it.  All source code created during
                        the competition will be available to anyone - spectators, members and sponsors and may be subject to challenge from
                        other members.  Your performance in a competition will allow us to help balance the competition.  It will be recorded
                        to calculate competition rating values and it will be posted on the web site and in the competition area.  Winners' names
                        may also be released to governmental authorities as required by law and to those requesting such information from
                        TopCoder.</p>
