                <br><br>

                <b>Registration</b><br>
                Registration will open on Tuesday, January 2 at 10:00 AM GMT/UTC -2 and will close on Tuesday,
                January 23 at 10:00 AM GMT/UTC -2. There is no limit to the number of registrants for the
                competition; however each individual may only register once.
                <br><br>

                <b>Qualification Round</b><br>
                The Qualification Round will be open for 24 hours from 12:00 PM Noon GMT/UTC -2 on Tuesday,
                January 23, 2007 through 12:00 PM Noon GMT/UTC -2 Wednesday, January 24, 2007.
                <br><br>

                The Qualification Round will consist of two phases: the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase.
                <ul>
                    <li>The Qualification Round Coding Phase is a timed event where contestants are presented with one
                        of five possible problem sets. Each problem set contains two questions representing two levels
                        of complexity and, accordingly, two levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question
                        are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based
                        on the total time elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.
                        Competitors will have 60 minutes to complete either or both of the problems. The 60 minutes will
                        begin to elapse once the first problem is opened. The timer in the coding window will count down
                        to the end of the 60 minutes. A competitor who begins the qualification attempt within the final
                        60 minutes of the Qualification Round will have less than 60 minutes to attempt
                        qualification.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Qualification Round System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code. If the TopCoder
                        System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the
                        points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a
                        set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a
                        coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The
                        same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given
                        question.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                The Qualification Round will contain (10) virtual rooms and five (5) problem sets. The top 100 scorers
                from each of the five problem sets presented during the Qualification Round will be eligible to compete
                in Round 1 of the Google Code Jam Latin America 2007.
                <br><br>

                <b>The Competition Field</b><br>
                Up to 500 individuals will qualify to compete in Round 1. The top 250 scorers from Round 1 will
                advance to Round 2. The top 50 scorers from Round 2 will advance to the onsite Championship Round.
                <br><br>
                The Rounds will be held on the following dates:

<span class="subTitle">About the Tournament</span><br>
<b>Use of Plugins in the Competition Arena</b><br>
The use of external TopCoder Arena plugins or any modifications to the TopCoder Arena functionality is strictly
prohibited.
<br><br>
<b>Unused Code Rule</b><br>
The unused code rule is not in effect for this event.
<br><br>
<b>Languages</b><br>
The competition is available in five programming languages - Java, C++, C#, VB.NET and Python.
<br><br>
<b>NOTE:</b> All submissions have a maximum of 2 seconds of runtime per test case.  This limit is used in harder
problems
to force submissions to be of a certain complexity.  Because the inherent speed differences between Python and the other
offered languages is large, some problems may require extra optimization or not be solvable using the Python language.
<br><br>
<b>Code Obfuscation</b><br>
Intentional obfuscation of code submissions is not allowed. Any code submission that contains obvious and deliberate
code
obfuscation will be rejected and any points received for that submission would not count towards your final score. For
the
purpose of this policy obfuscation is defined as "An obvious and deliberate attempt to disguise the true behavior or
nature
of the code." In ALL cases, TopCoder / Google will make the final decision as to whether or not a code submission has
been
intentionally obfuscated. In some cases, TopCoder / Google may decide to "nullify" any unsuccessful challenges that have
been applied against a code submission that is determined to be obfuscated. We encourage any competitor to notify us in
the
event that you feel that a code submission violates this policy.
<br><br>
<b>Online Elimination Rounds</b><br>
Everyone who competes in the online elimination rounds must log in to the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than ten
minutes prior to the start of the online round. All start times will be communicated as GMT/UTC -2, so contestants
in other time zones must adjust accordingly. If a coder does not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she
has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition.
<br><br>
All competitors who have been invited to compete will be randomly assigned to specific rooms, with up to 10 people in
each room. TopCoder will determine all room assignments prior to the start of each online round.
<br><br>
<b>Scoring and Advancing</b><br>
After each round of competition, the top scorers will be identified and will advance to the next round. Coder
advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round for each
coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater-than-zero) point total. The
structure of the online rounds is as follows:
<br><br>

<div class="indented">
    <b>Round 1 (online)</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Up to 500 coders will compete in Round 1. The 250 highest scoring competitors will advance to Round 2.
            Each coder must have positive points to advance, so if there are less than 250 competitors who score
            positive points, only those competitors with a positive point total will advance.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <b>Round 2 (online)</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Up to 250 coders will compete in Round 2. The 50 highest scoring competitors will advance to the
            Championship Round. Each coder must have positive points to advance, so if there are less than 50
            competitors who score positive points, only those competitors with a positive point total will advance.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <b>NOTE:</b> In the event of a tie for any advancing position (positive points only), all tied coders will advance
    to the Championship Round.
</div>
<br>
<b>Competition Round Structure</b><br>
Round 1, Round 2 and the Championship Round (excluding the Qualification Round) consists of three phases: the Coding
Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. The Qualification Round will consist only of the Coding Phase and
System Testing Phase. (See "Qualification Round" above for details regarding the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase
of the Qualification Round.)
<ul>
    <li>The Coding Phase is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing
        three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question are
        awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time
        elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.
    </li>
    <li>The Challenge Phase is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of
        other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points
        by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger. Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point
        reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.
    </li>
    <li>The System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If
        the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the
        points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs,
        expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not
        match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be
        applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be
        added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.
    </li>
</ul>

<b>Onsite Championship Round</b><br>
Up to 50 advancers from Round 2 will compete in the onsite Championship Round of the tournament being held on Thursday,
March 1, 2007.
<br><br>
<b>Visa Information</b><br>
If you need visa assistance, it is in your interest to make an appointment with the embassy early. Google will provide
visa letters after Round 1.
Round 1 advancers will receive more information upon notification of advancement.
<br><br>
Google will contact all finalists for travel information and will provide all travel accommodations for each finalist to
attend the Championship Round. In addition, Google will provide overnight accommodations and all travel arrangements to
and from the airport, as well as to and from the onsite round facility. All other expenses are the responsibility of the
contestant.
<br><br>
The Championship Round will be a single round of a maximum of 50 coders. Placement in the Championship Round is determined by
comparing the total points of each coder. The winner of the Championship Round will be the coder with the highest point
total for the round. In the event of a tie in the Championship Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner
(in order):
<ul>
    <li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during online Round 2.</li>
    <li>If a tie still remains, then by total points acquired (higher is better) during online Round 1.</li>
    <li>If a tie still remains, then the prize money will be distributed equally among the tied coders.</li>
</ul>

<span class="subTitle">About the Prizes</span><br>
The top 250 scorers from Round 2 will receive a "Google Code Jam Latin America 2007" t-shirt. In addition, the 50
finalists in the
Championship Round will receive prizes. Any and all applicable taxes on prizes are the sole responsibility of the
prizewinner. Prize money will be distributed as follows:
