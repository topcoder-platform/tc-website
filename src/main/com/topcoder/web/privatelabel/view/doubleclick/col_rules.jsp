            <p><span class="dc_subTitle">Summary of the Tournament</span><br/>
            The DoubleClick&#153; 2004 Coding Challenge ("DCCC") is being offered by DoubleClick Inc. ("DoubleClick") and TopCoder, Inc. ("TopCoder").  The DCCC will take place between Monday, February 9 and Friday, February 27, 2004.  It begins with a one-week online registration, after which all registered individuals will participate in a Qualification Round to determine who will compete in the subsequent two rounds of the programming tournament.  The entire tournament consists of a Qualification Round, the (1) main competition round, and one (1) onsite final round.  All participants who compete in the main competition round will receive a DoubleClick 2004 Coding Challenge T-shirt.  In addition, DoubleClick will award $10,000 in cash prizes to the 10 finalists in the tournament.</p>

            <a name="eligibility"></a>
            <p><span class="dc_subTitle">Eligibility</span><br/>
            Students meeting the following criteria are eligible to compete in the DoubleClick 2004 Coding Challenge:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Must be at least 18 years of age (as of February 9, 2004)</li>
            <li>Must be matriculated full-time at either Columbia University (2960 Broadway, New York, NY 10027) or New York University (22 Washington Square North, New York, NY 10011)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="dc_subTitle">Registration</span><br/>
            Registration will open on Monday, February 9 at 9:00AM ET and will close on Sunday, February 15 at 12:00PM ET.  Individuals can only register once.</p>

            <p><span class="dc_subTitle">Competition Advancement</span><br/>
            At the end of Round 1 (Qualification), all participants with positive (i.e., greater than zero) scores will be eligible to compete in Round 2 (Main Competition).  All participants competing in the main competition will be randomly assigned to specific virtual rooms, with up to 10 people in each room.  TopCoder will determine all room assignments prior to the start of the main competition round. The top 10 scorers from across all virtual rooms in Round 2 will advance to Round 3 (Final), which will be held onsite at DoubleClick's headquarters in New York, NY, USA.</p>

            <p><span class="dc_subTitle">Qualification Round</span><br/>
            Round 1, the Qualification Round, will be open for two (2) 12-hour sessions.  The first session will be open from 9:00AM through 9:00PM ET Monday, February 16, 2004.  The second session will be open from 9:00AM through 9:00PM ET Wednesday, February 18, 2004.  Participants can only attempt to qualify one time during one of the two sessions.</p>

            <p>The Qualification Round will consist of two phases: the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase.</p>

            <p>The <b>Coding Phase</b> is a timed event where participants are presented with one of two possible problems.  Points for the problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened to the time it was submitted.  Participants will have 60 minutes to complete the problem.  The timer in the coding window will count down to the end of the 60 minutes.  A participant who begins the round within the final 60 minutes of either session will have less than 60 minutes to attempt qualification.</p>

            <p>The <b>System Testing</b> Phase is a series of automated tests applied to all submitted code at the conclusion of the Qualification Round. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a participant's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given question.</p>

            <p>Upon logging in to the Competition Arena during the Qualification Round, each competitor who has registered for the DCCC will receive a message indicating which problem he/she has been assigned.  All participants who score positive points on the problem during the Qualification Round will be eligible to compete in Round 2 (Main Competition) of the DCCC.</p>

            <a name="about"></a>
            <p><span class="dc_subTitle">About the Tournament</span><br/>
            <span class="dc_subTitle">Use of Plugins in the Competition Arena</span><br/>
            The use of external TopCoder Arena plugins or any modifications to the Competition Arena functionality is strictly prohibited.</p>

            <p><span class="dc_subTitle">Logging In to the Competition Round</span><br/>
            All participants in Round 2 must log in to the Competition Arena no later than ten minutes prior to the start of the online round.  If a participant does not participate, for any reason, in the online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition. </p>

            <p><span class="dc_subTitle">Scoring and Advancing</span><br/>
            After the results of Round 2 are compiled, the top 10 scorers will be identified and will advance to Round 3, the Final Round.  Each participant must have positive points to advance, so if there are less than 10 participants who score positive points, only those competitors with a positive point total will advance.  Participant advancement is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round (see Structure of Rounds 2 and 3) for each participant.</p>

            <p>NOTE:  In the event of a tie for an advancing position from Round 2 to Round 3, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during Round 1, the Qualification Round</li>
            <li>If a tie still remains, all tied participants will advance to the next round</li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="dc_subTitle">Structure of Rounds 2 and 3</span><br/>
            Rounds 2 and 3 consist of three phases: the Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. Round 1, the Qualification Round, will consist only of the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase.  (See "Qualification Round" for details.)</p>

            <ul>
            <li>The <b>Coding Phase</b> is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles, and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.</li>
            <li>The <b>Challenge Phase</b> is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other participants' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 50 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition. </li>
            <li>The <b>System Testing Phase</b> is a series of automated tests applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a participant's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the global set of test cases that are used to test all submitted code in the System Testing Phase.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="dc_subTitle">Onsite Final Round</span><br/>
            The 10 advancers from Round 2 will travel, at their own expense, to DoubleClick's headquarters to compete in the Final Round of the tournament being held on Friday, February 27, 2004 at 1:00PM ET.  Each finalist must confirm his/her attendance in the Final Round by 5:00PM ET on Tuesday, February 24, 2004.  If a participant does not confirm his/her attendance in the Final Round by this time, he/she will forfeit eligibility to receive a prize, and his/her spot in the tournament will be given to the next highest scorer from Round 2.</p>

            <p>The Final Round will consist of a single virtual room of 10 participants, all 10 of whom will win a cash prize, depending on how each places in the round.  The participant with the highest point value in the Final Round will be declared the first place winner.  In the event of a tie in the Final Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order):</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during Round 2</li>
            <li>If a tie still remains in the Championship Round, then the prize money will be distributed equally among the tied participants.</li>
            </ul>

            <a name="prizes"></a>
            <p><span class="dc_subTitle">About the Prizes</span><br/>
            All participants who compete in Round 2 will receive a DoubleClick 2004 Coding Challenge T-shirt.  In addition, the 10 finalists in Round 3 will receive cash prizes.  Any and all applicable taxes on prizes are the sole responsibility of the prizewinner.  Prizes will be distributed as follows:</p>
