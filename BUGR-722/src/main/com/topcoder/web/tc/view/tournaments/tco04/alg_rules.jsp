            <p><span class="bodySubtitle">12:00PM ET TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7 - 12:00PM ET WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8</span></p>

            <p>The Qualification Round will be open for 24 hours from 12:00PM ET Tuesday, September 7 through
            12:00PM ET Wednesday, September 8, 2004.  Each competitor may participate in the Qualification
            Round at any time during the 24 hours.  Competitors may only attempt to qualify one time during the 24 hours.</p>

            <p>The Qualification Round will consist of two phases: the Coding Phase and the System Test Phase.
            The Qualification Round will not include a Challenge Phase.</p>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>The Qualification Round Coding Phase</strong> is a timed event where contestants are presented with one of
            	five possible problem sets.  Each problem set contains two questions representing two levels of complexity and, accordingly,
            	two levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully
            	compiles and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.
            	Competitors will have 60 minutes to complete either or both of the problems.  The 60 minutes will begin to elapse once the
            	first problem is opened.  The timer in the coding window will count down to the end of the 60 minutes.  A competitor who begins
            	the qualification attempt within the final 60 minutes of the Qualification Round will have less than 60 minutes to attempt
            	qualification.</li>
            	<li><strong>The Qualification Round System Testing Phase</strong> is applied to all submitted code at the conclusion of
            	the Qualification Round. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose
            	all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs,
            	expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the
            	expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code
            	submissions for a given question. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Upon logging in to the TopCoder Arena during the Qualification Round, each competitor who has registered for the Algorithm
            Competition will receive a message indicating which set of problems he/she has been assigned.  The highest 100 scorers from
            each of the five problem sets presented during the Qualification Round will be eligible to compete in Online Round #1 of the
            Algorithm Competition.  A maximum of 500 competitors will advance.  Members will be rated at the conclusion of the Qualification
            Round based on their performance against other competitors with the same problem set.  All qualifiers will be assigned tournament
            seeds based on their Algorithm rating following the Qualification Round.</p>

            <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Online Elimination Rounds</span><br/>
            Everyone who competes in an online round must login to the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than
            ten (10) minutes prior to the start of the online round. (See the schedule for competition dates and times.)
            <strong>TopCoder members from around the world may be participating in these online rounds, but all start times will be
            communicated as Eastern Time, so contestants in different time zones must adjust accordingly. </strong>If a coder does
            not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic
            loss in that round of competition. </p>

            <p>All competitors who have qualified for an online round will be assigned to a specific room. TopCoder will determine
            all room assignments prior to the start of each online round in a manner such that the average competitor rating
            (following the Qualification Round) for each room will be similar.  The dates and times of the online rounds of competition
            are as follows: </p>

            <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Scoring and Advancing during Online Rounds</span><br/>
            After each round of competition, the winners from each of the assigned rooms will be identified
            and will advance to the next online round. Coder advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing
            the total point values from all three phases of the round (see Competition Round Structure) for each coder.
            In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater-than-zero) point total.
            The structure of the online rounds is as follows:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Online Round #1</strong><br/>
					Up to 500 coders will compete and up to 200 will advance. The winner of each of the 50 rooms will
					automatically advance to Online Round #2.  The remaining 150 spots will be "wildcards", and will be
					awarded based on total points across all rooms.  (In the event there are less than 50 room winners
					in Round #1, the total number of wildcard spots will be equal to 200 minus the actual number of room winners.)</li>
            	<li><strong>Online Round #2</strong><br/>
					Up to 200 coders will compete and up to 100 will advance. The winner of each of the 20 rooms will automatically
					advance to Online Round #3.  The remaining 80 spots will be wildcards and will be awarded based on total points
					across all rooms.  (In the event there are less than 20 room winners in Round #2, the total number of wildcard spots
					will be equal to 100 minus the actual number of room winners.)</li>
            	<li><strong>Online Round #3</strong><br/>
					Up to 100 coders will compete and up to 50 will advance.  The winner of each of the 10 rooms will automatically
					advance to Online Round #4.  The remaining 40 spots will be wildcards and will be awarded based on total points
					across all rooms.  (In the event there are less than 10 room winners in Round #3, the total number of wildcard
					spots will be equal to 50 minus the actual number of room winners.)</li>
            	<li><strong>Online Round #4</strong><br/>
					Up to 50 coders will compete and up to 24 will advance.  The winner of each of the 5 rooms will automatically advance
					to the field of Semifinalists.  The remaining 19 spots will be wildcards and will be awarded based on total points
					across all rooms.  (In the event there are less than 5 room winners in Round #4, the total number of wildcard spots
					will be equal to 24 minus the actual number of room winners.)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>NOTE:  In the event of a tie for any advancing position (i.e., room winner or wildcard spot), the tie will be resolved in
            the following manner:</p>

            <blockquote><ul>
            	<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during the rounds of the tournament in which all of the tied participants were presented with the same set of problems (excluding the Qualification Round).</li>
            	<li>If a tie still remains, then by rating (higher is better) following the Qualification Round.</li>
       			<li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round.</li>
            </ul></blockquote>

            <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Round Structure</span><br/>
            With the exception of the Qualification Round, each online and onsite round of competition consists of three phases:
            the Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. (Note: the format of these competition rounds is similar
            to the format of the Single Round Matches.)</p>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>The Coding Phase</strong> is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing
            	three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a problem are awarded
            	upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated on the total time elapsed from the time
            	the problem was opened until the time it was submitted.</li>

            	<li><strong>The Challenge Phase</strong> is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other
            	competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the
            	defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 50
            	points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition. </li>

            	<li><strong>The System Testing Phase</strong> is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged.
            	If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the
            	points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs,
            	expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not
            	match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be
            	applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be
            	added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Onsite Semifinal and Championship Rounds</span><br/>
            The twenty-four (24) advancers from Online Round #4 will travel to the Santa Clara Marriott on Wednesday,
            November 10th to compete in the Semifinal round of the tournament being held on Thursday, November 11th.
            All contestants must arrive at the Santa Clara Marriott no later than 4:00 PM PT on Wednesday, November 10th.
            If a contestant is unable to attend the onsite rounds, he/she will forfeit his/her eligibility to receive a prize,
            and his/her spot in the tournament will be given to the next highest overall scorer from Online Round #4. </p>

            <p>TopCoder will provide travel arrangements for each competitor, up to a cost of $1,000 per person. (That is, if a contestant's
            airfare is greater than $1,000, the contestant will be responsible for the difference between the cost of the airfare and $1,000.)
            TopCoder will provide ground transportation to and from the airport, as well as accommodations and certain meals for each contestant.
            All other expenses are the responsibility of the contestant.  TopCoder will not provide travel or lodging accommodations for competitor
            guests at the 2004 TopCoder Open.  </p>

            <p>TopCoder will determine the room assignments for the Semifinal rooms prior to the start of each Semifinal round, in a manner such
            that the average competitor rating (following the Qualification Round) for each room will be similar.  The dates and times of the
            onsite Semifinal and Championship rounds are as follows:</p>

            The winner in each room will advance to the Championship Round.  The 2nd and 3rd place finishers in each room will
            participate in one (1) Wildcard Round.  The winner of the Wildcard Round will also advance to the Championship Round.
