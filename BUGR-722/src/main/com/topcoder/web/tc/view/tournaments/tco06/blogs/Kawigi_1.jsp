Well, this morning was like Christmas for a kid with ADD. I woke up an
hour or so before my alarm went off and finally got up about 20 minutes
later and just turned off my alarm so it wouldn't bother my wife. How
could I keep sleeping? Why wasn't my plane ready to leave yet? Well,
that's probably a good thing, since I'm not at the Seattle-Tacoma
airport yet. I was leaving in a few short hours to the onsite finals of
the TopCoder Open!
<br><br>
Now, have I ever been onsite? Well kind of, but not for TopCoder. I
attended the <A target="_blank" href="/?t=sponsor&c=link&link=http://icpc.baylor.edu/past/icpc2004/report.html">ACM ICPC World Finals</a>
in 2004, shortly after I first registered on TopCoder. But at the time, I didn't know who
anyone was - I met <tc-webtag:handle coderId="260835" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="284007" darkBG="true" /> (who
made fun of the size of a Tablet PC I got from my school every time he
saw me), but I had no idea that I'd care later. Now I'm right here, with
the same people I've been competing with in the arena, chatting with
after matches, and goofing off with in the forums.
<br><br>
When I got to the airport, I punched in my confirmation number at the
checkin desk, and it found my reservation. I was told to go to gate A1
(that's easy enough to remember), and I didn't notice anything abnormal
until I'd been waiting at that gate for about an hour. Someone sat down
near me and was talking to someone on their cell phone and saying how
there was still more than an hour before the flight boards. I looked at
my phone, and the time was 12:55 PM - within about 2 minutes of the
departure time I'd written down. Then I looked at my ticket. My ticket
definitely said "Las Vegas", and definitely had my name on it. But it
didn't leave until 2:40, and it was on a different airline. Well, my
laptop was already plugged in and I was just leaving the Stone Age in
<A target="_blank" href="/?t=sponsor&c=link&link=http://www.civ3.com/">Civilization 3</a>. Looks like I might make it to the
industrial age by the time I board.
<br><br>
Finally it was time to get on the plane. I thought I saw someone who
looked like <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11797255" darkBG="true" /> walk by before I got up. I
managed to get myself moved from a middle seat to a window seat earlier,
so I sat down in my proud window seat and waited for awhile, playing a
couple rounds of <A target="_blank" href="/?t=sponsor&c=link&link=http://www.gamehouse.com/onlinegames/playgame.jsp?navnum=9&AID=&game=twist&code=TextTwist">TextTwist</a>
on my PDA before they told us to put away our electronics. It was
looking like I might have my row to myself on a moderately crowded
plane, but right before we took off, an impossibly large woman got in
the aisle seat next to me (strictly speaking, the aisle seat isn't next
to me, but she still basically was). Well, time to take off.
<br><br>
After finishing my refreshments, I decided to whip out my laptop. Some
planes these days have little screens that show you exactly where you
are on a map. This one didn't. But it's all just software. I pulled my
USB GPS locator out of my backpack and suction-cupped it to the window
next to me. That's what I love about window seats :-) I started up my
mapping software and I found my location a bit faster than usual - I was
flying over southern Oregon. The roadblock next to me was falling
asleep, so I really didn't have anything in particular to do or anyone
to talk to. Well, time to continue that game of Civ3 (occasionally
peeking at the map between turns). My laptop kept changing its mind
about whether the plane was going 50 miles per hour or 370 miles per
hour. I tend to think it was correct in the latter case.
<br><br>
With about 40 minutes left in the flight, I looked at the map on my
computer, and it was apparent that we'd start our descent soon. I didn't
have to look at anything for it to be obvious that I really needed to
pee. Unfortunately, I was less than tempted to wake up sleeping beauty
in the aisle seat to ask if I could get past. Maybe that wasn't the best
decision, but since I didn't end up peeing my pants, it wasn't
necessarily the worst. I still wonder how many Joules would have been
expended between the two of us just so I could go to the bathroom and
get back in later.
<br><br>
Getting off the plane, what should be the first thing I see in Las Vegas
but slot machines? Yeah, not my favorite thing about Nevada, but it's
definitely a thing about Nevada (and it's the reason it's such a big
vacation spot for so many people). It reminded me of a time years ago
when I had a layover in Las Vegas and the flight attendants said it was
good luck to buckle your seat belt across your seat behind you. Sure,
I'd have done it if they'd just asked. But if you have a
40-something-year-old Chinese woman telling you it's good luck, and you
just arrived in Las Vegas - you guessed it. Everyone did it without
question. I should try playing that card while I'm here ;-)
<br><br>
/*Skips some of the mundane stuff to more mundane stuff*/
<br><br>
When I got my luggage, I had to interpret my instructions to get
transportation to my hotel. I found the shuttle service, and I was the
first person on my shuttle. Once on the shuttle, I thought I saw
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="11797255" darkBG="true" /> out the window again. I figured the
shuttle was going to wait around until there were a few more people, so
I decided to take out the old Lappy and start writing up a program to
use to write blog entries in. Maybe I should have just started writing,
but this is about software, man! A couple with a heavy accent got on,
and then <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11797255" darkBG="true" /> (ha! I knew it was him!) and
another couple. Then we were unloaded LIFO, although the real reason I
was the last to be dropped off was probably just that the hotel I needed
to check into was slightly further from the airport. We don't get to
stay at the Aladdin, we just get to walk back and forth to it every day
from <A target="_blank" href="/?t=sponsor&c=link&link=http://www.caesars.com/ballys/lasvegas/">Bally's hotel</a> :-)<br><br>
<br><br>
After checking in, I walked over to the Aladdin to try and find
everyone. I'm not quite sure who it was who saw me wandering and came
out to help me find my way to where everyone was hanging out, but he had
one of those conference ID thingies around his neck with IBM printed on
the front of it, and I immediately recognized that this person had
competed in the International Collegiate Programming Contest. Sounds
like my kind of guy. When I came in, I saw <tc-webtag:handle coderId="260835" darkBG="true" />,

<tc-webtag:handle coderId="272072" darkBG="true" />
 and a few other people talking about
something that was probably beyond my mortal understanding. The first
person to introduce himself was 

<tc-webtag:handle coderId="7501828" darkBG="true" />

, but I
didn't understand for a moment when he told me.
<br><br>
In a few short minutes, they opened the doors to a room with what I can
only assume is a physical implementation of the TopCoder arena. Nearby
were booths set up by the sponsors, some hors d'&#156;urves, and the familiar
faces of the TopCoder staff. I started finding people who I recognized
and saying hi and introducing myself to them.
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="272072" darkBG="true" />, 
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="260835" darkBG="true" />,
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="8355516" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="282718" darkBG="true" />,
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="251184" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7446789" darkBG="true" />,
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="10599449" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="275071" darkBG="true" /> and
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" darkBG="true" /> are just a handful of the people I stopped to
introduce myself to, to varying reactions. I also couldn't forget to
greet <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7267401" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="100142" darkBG="true" />,
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="7346876" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="119655" darkBG="true" />,
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="156859" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="305384" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="14999860" darkBG="true" />,
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="155846" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="15545604" darkBG="true" /> and everyone else I
recognized from behind the scenes at TopCoder, as well as the other
bloggers. Funny story - I said hi to <tc-webtag:handle coderId="100142" darkBG="true" />, or maybe
asked him a question, and then someone else (I think it was
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="251184" darkBG="true" />), asked him if he recognized who I was, which he
didn't. Then he said something like "at least you don't recognize me,
either." Considering <A target="_blank" href="/?t=sponsor&c=link&link=http://blogs.msdn.com/kawigi/archive/2005/11/16/493810.aspx">I've met him before</a>, I
actually did know who he was without him telling me. Gotta be awkward
:-p Well, we'll wish him better luck next time.
<br><br>
A few of the staff got up and made announcements and welcome speeches
and whatnot (hmmm, mostly announcements), which were probably the point
of this get-together. It's funny that they talk for 20 minutes but they
schedule 2 hours for it, but it's probably a good idea. Eventually
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="251184" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="21518515" darkBG="true" />,
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="21471147" darkBG="true" /> and I headed back for our hotel, where I
figured I'd be able to get charged an arm and a leg for a dependable
internet connection and finish writing this. It was fun talking to Grace
and David on the way back, they had the basic idea of what was going on,
but they had loads of questions about the specifics of what was going to
be happening in the next few days. <A href="http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=284244&start=0&mc=15">DP Lass</a> and I, of course, have never physically attended or competed in a
TopCoder final, but I'd have to admit I'm geeky enough to have...
<br><br>
   1. Watched from the arena online during a tournament final
   2. Read the rules way too much
   3. Partially implemented a Java Applet to allow people to pick
      tournament winners, like in NCAA Basketball pools (hmmm, maybe I
      should finish that for the next TCCC)
<br><br>
...so needless to say we still knew the answers to their questions :-)
<br><br>
And David - I <em>swear</em> that's the last DP Lass joke.
