                         NVIDIA is the first semiconductor company to deliver a complete top-to-bottom series of 3D graphics solutions for work or 
                        play with complete support across multiple operating systems. The GeForce&#153;  brand of Graphics Processing Unit (GPUs) provides all consumers 
                        and corporate users with the ultimate in 3D, 2D, and HDTV performance for entertainment and gaming; high-speed application performance; rich visuals; 
                        and crystal clear resolutions which are imperative for the corporate market. GeForce is the brand of choice for the world's leading PC manufactures and 
                        add-in-card vendors. NVIDIA's Quadro&#153;  line is the company's first family of graphics boards for the workstation market. NVIDIA's technology 
                        leadership combines the Quadro- based workstation GPU with the NVIDIA unified driver architecture (UDA) on a single AGP card, providing graphics 
                        and design professionals a complete solution for both development and deployment of leading edge content. NVIDIA has extended its workstation solutions 
                        to feature the Quadro2 Go, the industry's first mobile workstation GPU, delivering workstation-class features, performance, and benefits for professionals 
                        on the go. </p>
                        <p><strong>Mobile</strong><br/>With the GeForce Go family of mobile graphics processors, NVIDIA was the first to deliver high-performance 3D to the mobile market - 
                        and with the world's first mobile workstation GPU, Quadro2 Go, engineers and animators for the first time can achieve real-time interactivity on a mobile 
                        platform. The ability to impress audiences and clients with interactive multimedia presentations and animations is only limited by the imagination-not the 
                        notebook. The end user will also appreciate the ability to game on the go with a world-class entertainment solution. </p>
                        <p><strong>Platform Architecture</strong><br/>NVIDIA's nForce&#153;  Platform Processing Architecture addresses the needs of today's most demanding users, all of 
                        whom expect vastly improved system performance, high-speed networking, rich streaming media, Dolby&#153;  Digital 5.1 audio, and high-performance 
                        graphics from their PC. To bridge the gap between the expectations of today's users and the limitations of current technologies, and to deliver unmatched system 
                        performance, it was necessary for NVIDIA to depart from the traditional "Northbridge/Southbridge" chipset architectures to create an entirely new class of PC. 
                        NVIDIA's nForce Platform Processing Architecture is comprised of a family of platform processors: the nForce Integrated Graphics Processor (IGP), the nForce 
                        System Platform Processors (SSP) and the nForce Media and Communications Processor (MCP).</p>
                        <p><strong>Video</strong><br/>NVIDIA's Personal Cinema&#153;  product is the only complete digital entertainment experience designed with the consumer in mind. With a simple 
                        hardware setup and intuitive software, NVIDIA Personal Cinema combines exceptional video functionality with the award-winning 3D performance NVIDIA is known

                        graphics, a seamlessly integrated software suite, and the industry's first multi-function, wireless remote control. </p>
                        <p><strong>Consumer Electronics</strong><br/>Xbox&#153; , the highly-anticipated video game console from Microsoft&#174;, delivers superior graphics, incredible audio, 
                        and the most intense, action-packed gaming experiences available via the NVIDIA Xbox Graphics Processing Unit (XGPU) and Xbox Media and Communications 
                        Processor (MCPX). Together, NVIDIA's XGPU and MCPX processors deliver jaw-dropping 3D graphics, DVD and HDTV, 3D environmental audio and broadband 
                        connectivity. </p>
                        <p><strong>Customers</strong><br/>NVIDIA works with all of the world's leading OEMs including Compaq, Dell, Gateway, MicronPC, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Microsoft, Sony,
