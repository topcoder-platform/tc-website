			On the member registration page, there is a "Referring Member" field. If you convince a fellow coder to register with TopCoder, 
			ask him or her to provide your handle in the "Referring Member" field.</P>

			<P>The referring member (you) will receive a referral commission equal to 10% of any 
			cash prize that the referred member wins during the 12 months following registration.</P>


			<P>TopCoder will keep track of all member commissions earned and will pay them out at the end of each quarter. </P>

			<P>The "Referring Member" field in the registration cannot be changed once the registration process has been completed. 
			Therefore, please ensure that any referred member provides the correct handle upon registering with TopCoder.</P>

			<P><STRONG><font size="4">Official Rules</font></STRONG><BR/>
			The Referral Program will apply only to those referred members who have registered with TopCoder between April 29, 
			2004 and April 28, 2005.</P>

			<P>Any eligible TopCoder member whose TopCoder handle was provided in the "Referring Member" field of the TopCoder 
			registration process on or after April 29, 2004 will be placed into the Referral Program.</P>

			<P>TopCoder will pay a referral commission equal to 10% of any cash prize won by a referred member during the 365-day 
			period following the initial registration date of the referred member. No additional referral compensation will be paid 
			for a referred member's winnings following the one-year anniversary of the referred member's registration. </P>

			<P>To receive a referral commission, the TopCoder member must be 18 years of age or older and must not have been permanently 
			suspended from participating in TopCoder competitions.  Payment is contingent upon TopCoder receiving a completed affidavit 
			of eligibility, verifying the member's eligibility to participate in the Referral Program, and a completed appropriate tax form.</P>

			<P>The "Referring Member" field in the registration may not be changed once the registration process has been completed.</P>

			<P>TopCoder prohibits members from "spamming" individuals with unsolicited emails in an attempt to entice people 
			to register and participate at TopCoder. Sending such unsolicited emails may lead to your termination from the TopCoder Referral Program.</P>

			<P>TopCoder reserves the right to modify or cancel the TopCoder Referral Program at any time for any reason. TopCoder also reserves 
			the right to disqualify any TopCoder member from the TopCoder Referral Program at any time for any reason.</P>
