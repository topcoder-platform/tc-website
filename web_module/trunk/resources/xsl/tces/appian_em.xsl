Subject line:  Software Engineers wanted at Appian</p>

<p>Hello [handle]:</p>

<p>Appian Corporation, a global technology consulting firm, is a leading provider of large-scale, data-driven 
solutions. Appian solutions allow clients to increase the quality and speed of their decision-making, maximize 
profit, and improve customer care by integrating and transforming business data into personalized business 
intelligence.</p>

<p>Since 1999, Appian revenue and personnel have increased by 100% annually. We are completely self-funded 
and profitable. Such solid, triple-digit growth is unusual during an economic downturn. But then, Appian isn't 
like other companies.</p>

<p>If you're interested in experiencing the difference at Appian, check out their need for Software Engineers:  <A href="/?t=tces&amp;c=appian">www.topcoder.com/?t=tces&amp;c=appian</A></p>

<p>Thank you, and as always, good luck in the Arena!<br/>
The TopCoder Employment Services Team</p>
