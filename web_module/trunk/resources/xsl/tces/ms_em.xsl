<P>Dear [handle]:</P>
<P>
At Microsoft, we see no limits to the potential we all might reach because we see no limits to human imagination.  That is what inspires us.  And that is why we create software that helps people and businesses reach their potential.  It's not just our purpose.  It's our passion.  
</P>
<P>
Imagine having the resources to influence tomorrow's reality today, and having fun while you do it. That's Microsoft. Right now, we're looking for the next Microsoft innovators. If you're ready to discover just how far your talents can take you, we invite you to learn more about our world. From there, how far you go is up to you.</P>
