<P>Dear [handle]:</P>
<P>
At Microsoft, they see no limits to the potential we all might reach because they see no limits to human imagination.  That is what inspires them.  And that is why they create software that helps people and businesses reach their potential.  It's not just their purpose.  It's their passion.  
</P>
<P>
Imagine having the resources to influence tomorrow's reality today, and having fun while you do it. That's Microsoft. Right now, they're looking for the next Microsoft innovators. If you're ready to discover just how far your talents can take you, Microsoft invites you to learn more about their world. From there, how far you go is up to you.</P>
