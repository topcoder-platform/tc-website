<B>64 Finalists Emerge From Field of Over 1,000 Programmers</B><BR/> 
The 2002 TopCoder Invitational kicked off earlier this month with over 1,000 of the highest-rated 
TopCoder members from around the world competing for the chance to advance in the annual tournament.  
Four online eliminations rounds were held this month.  These elimination rounds resulted in a field of 64 emerging as the best coders in the world.  The 64 competitors will next compete on Wednesday, October 30th, with the 16 highest scoring members in that round advancing to the semifinal round of the tournament.  The "sweet 16" will compete in the tournament's final onsite rounds and will vie for the $50,000 grand prize.  The Semifinal and Championship rounds will be held November 22nd and 23rd at the Mohegan Sun Casino.

<B>The Best of the Best</B><BR/>
Some fierce competition transpired this month during the online rounds, and there are some repeat appearances by some TopCoder veterans.  The reigning TopCoder Invitational Champion, Jon McAlister, has advanced to the field of 64.  The Stanford University senior, along with his classmate, Daniel Wright, continues to dominate the field.  Wright is also a veteran of TopCoder tournaments, as he won the 2002 Sun Microsystems and TopCoder Collegiate Challenge held this past April.  Wright and McAlister are seeded 8th and 23rd, respectively, in the tournament.
</P>

<P>
Five out of the top 10 tournament competitors are college students.  Reid Barton (seeded 2nd) is a sophomore at MIT.  John Dethridge (seeded 4th) has a long trip if he advances to the finals.  Dethridge is pursing his doctorate degree from the University of Melbourne in Australia.  Nathan Paymer (seeded 7th) is a senior at the California Institute of Technology.  Paymer was also a semifinalist in the 2002 Sun Microsystems and TopCoder Collegiate Challenge.  The 10th seed in the tournament is Chuong Do, a junior at Stanford University.

<P>
Although the tournament is open to both student and professional TopCoder members, college students dominate the field with 43 competitors.  The top three schools (and the number of students from each) that are represented in the 2002 TopCoder Invitational are:  MIT (7), Stanford (5), and the California Institute of Technology (3).
