<p><strong>GLASTONBURY, CT, February 16, 2005&#151;</strong>
TopCoder, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, skills assessment and competitive software development, today announced NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA), a worldwide leader in graphics and digital media processors, as Premier sponsor of its 2005 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge (TCCC 05).  This will be the 3rd consecutive Collegiate Challenge sponsored by NVIDIA, which was among the first companies to partner with TopCoder and its powerful community of programmers. The TCCC 05 will bring many of the world's finest student programmers together in competition over the course of ten weeks for international ranking, notoriety and a share of the $150,000 prize purse for Algorithm, Component Design and Development categories. Details and rules are provided at: http://www.topcoder.com/tccc05.
<br /><br />
"NVIDIA recognizes that it takes amazing people to build great products," said Ben de Waal, VP of GPU Software, NVIDIA Corporation. "We are excited to return as Premier Sponsor of the TopCoder Collegiate Challenge and to interact with some of the sharpest developers in the world." 
<br /><br />
What began as an initial round with more than 1,300 coders jockeying for programming position, will culminate in an exciting face-to-face "code off" between 24 Algorithm and 8 Component competitors at the Santa Clara Marriott on March 10th and 11th, 2005.  
<br /><br />
"NVIDIA is a true technology visionary committed to advancing the state of the digital gaming and graphics industry to as yet only dreamed of levels," said Rob Hughes, president of TopCoder.
