                        been customized for Sun, allowing them to host the JavaOne Coding Challenge at their flagship developer conference.  
                        The Challenge is open to all registered onsite attendees of the Conference, being held June 10-13, at the Moscone Center

                        able to enhance the experience for programmers who attend the Conference.  Sun's commitment to Java technology is 
                        evident in its continued improvements to the JavaOne conference and its support of TopCoder and its developer base."</p>

                        <p>The JavaOne Coding Challenge offers attendees an opportunity to apply technical knowledge learned during Conference 
                        technical sessions to real-world problems.  The Coding Challenge will center on the Conference themes of Mobility, 
                        Enterprise Applications and Java Web Services.</p>

                        <p>"Sun is dedicated to making the JavaOne conference the essential source for Java technology education and innovation," 
                        said Mike Bellissimo, senior director, Sun Software Developer Marketing and Management.  "We are excited that TopCoder 
                        will offer onsite attendees a practical application testing their knowledge of Java technology learned during the JavaOne 
                        conference."</p>
