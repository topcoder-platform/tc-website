    "Many people think of software engineers as antisocial without a
competitive bone in their bodies," said James Gosling, Vice President and Sun
Fellow, Sun Microsystems, Inc. "But while we may be 'differently social', we
are very competitive, especially about the activity at the core of our
profession:  coding. The folks at TopCoder have done a great job of
formalizing the informal competitions that hackers have always engaged in, and
I'm looking forward to the Java Coding Challenge at the SunNetwork
Conference."
</P>
<P>
    The Challenge will commence with a qualification round on September 18th,
which will be open to everyone attending the SunNetwork Conference with the
top 32 performers advancing to the next round of competition. Through
elimination rounds, the field of 32 competitors will then be narrowed to an
elite "Final Four," who will compete in the Championship round for the grand
prize of $50,000. The second place winner will receive $15,000, the third
place winner takes home $10,000 and the fourth place winner captures the final
$5,000. The championship round will be held at 4:00 p.m. PDT on Thursday,
September 19th at the Moscone Center. The grand prize winner will be awarded a
check for $50,000 on Friday, September 20th at 9:00 a.m. PDT by James Gosling
and Bill Joy prior to the closing keynote of the conference. Competition
updates will be published on the Sun web site,
http://sunnetwork.sun.com/sf2002/topcoder/ throughout the tournament.
