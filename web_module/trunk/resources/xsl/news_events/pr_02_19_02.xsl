<P>GLASTONBURY, CT., Feb. 19, 2002 - TopCoder, Inc., a company committed to identifying and promoting computer programming talent through competition, today announced the field for its 2002 Collegiate Challenge, sponsored by Sun Microsystems.  The tournament, which will award a total prize purse of $150,000, begins tonight.</P>
<P>Elimination rounds will crown Regional Champions and reduce the field to 16<BR/>The 2002 Sun Microsystems and TopCoder Collegiate Challenge brings together 512 of the highest-rated TopCoder college-level members, identified based upon their performance in TopCoder competitions, for four rounds of online regional competition.  The winner of each region will be crowned the Regional Champion, win $5,000 and automatically advance to the final field of 16 competitors.  This elite 16 will compete in the tournament's final two onsite rounds and vie for their share of $150,000.  The Semifinal and Championship rounds will be held April 19 and 20, 2002 at the University Park Hotel @ MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  There, the tournament champion will win $100,000.</P>
<P><DIV CLASS="bodyTextBold">Top U.S. Schools represented</DIV>The top-five schools, and number of students from each, that will be represented in the Collegiate Challenge are:  MIT (37), the University of Michigan (24), Georgia Tech (22), Stanford University (20), and the University of Texas-Austin (16).  Stanford junior Jon McAlister is ranked first in the West region and is the highest rated member entering the tournament.  McAlister was the runner-up in last year's Collegiate Challenge, and followed that performance with a first-place win at the 2001 TopCoder Invitational held in November 2001, which featured TopCoder's top-rated collegiate and professional members.</P>

Woolever is currently a Senior Research and Development Engineer at Synopsys, Inc. of Sunnyvale, California.</P>
