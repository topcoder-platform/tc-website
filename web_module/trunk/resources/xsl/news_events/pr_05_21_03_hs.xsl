                        </div>

                        <p><strong>STORRS, CT&#151;May 21, 2003&#151;</strong>TopCoder, Inc., the leader in promotion of 
                        programming talent through online competition, today announced the winning team of the 2003 TopCoder High School 
                        Challenge.  Amity Regional Senior High School out-performed 7 other Connecticut high school teams to claim the 
                        victory in the tournament, which concluded yesterday at UConn's Homer Babbidge Library.  "UConn was thrilled to 
                        host this programming competition.  The computer lab in the Babbidge library is ideally suited for such an event, and 
                        we were proud to have these accomplished high school students demonstrate their skills here at UConn," said Peter 
                        Murray, UConn's Director of Library Information Services.</p>


                        <p>Amity clinched the title with a score of nine points (the lowest point total wins).  This score bested their closest 
                        challenger, Norwich Free Academy, who finished with a score of twenty-eight points.  Tolland High School finished 
                        third with a score of thirty-two points.</p>

                        <p>The Amity team was made up of senior Dany Qumsiyeh, and juniors Nathan Perelman and Bradford Galiette.  The 
                        team's coach, Frank Barretta, has been with the school for three years as a faculty member in the Mathematics/Computer 
                        Science Department.  In addition to coaching this championship programming team, Coach Barretta is also an Amity 
                        youth football coach.  "My team is pretty modest.  They claim that they are not really better programmers than the 
                        others here today, rather they simply drank more Coke," said Barretta with a smile.  He continued by saying, "This 
                        accomplishment is the result of the tremendous amount of effort they've put forth to be the best.  They are obviously 
                        very bright kids and when you combine that with the hard work and great competitive attitudes, well, I'm just glad 
                        that it all paid off today.  I'm proud of the whole team and we are all grateful to TopCoder, CAS and UConn for hosting 
                        such a great event.  We are looking forward to next year."</p>

                        <p>The 2003 TopCoder High School Challenge began in March with an eight-week schedule of qualifying rounds.  
                        These competitions saw dozens of Connecticut's best young programmers competing online in real time each week.  
                        To be eligible for the finals, at least three coders from each school must have competed in four of the eight qualifying 
                        rounds.  During these qualifying rounds, the average of the top three scorers from each school was used to determine 
                        which school would win for the week.  For more details and photos of the competition, please visit

                        <p>"This competition brings the same platform that we use for college students and professionals every week to these 
                        incredibly talented high school students," said Rob Hughes, President of TopCoder, Inc.  "It is clear that these students 
                        will be amongst the best and the brightest at whatever institution they pursue following high school.  I'm sure we will 
                        see some of these same students in our collegiate and professional tournaments in years to come."</p>

                        <p>"CAS strives to bring academic competitions to the same level of excitement as high school athletic events here in 
                        Connecticut.   The 2003 TopCoder High School Challenge has allowed us to take a giant step in that direction," said Mike 
                        Savage, Executive Director of CAS.  "Putting technology and real-world problems in the hands of these high school 
                        students created a great competition."</p>
