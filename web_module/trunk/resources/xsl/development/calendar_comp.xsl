<B>Overview</B>
</P>

<P>
The calendar component provides applications a single point of control for calendar management.  
Its functionality extends from displaying a simple "pop-up" calendar that simplifies date selection on web-based 
forms, to displaying a complex calendar complete with customized content, "look and feel" and hyperlinks.
An example of a calendar that would benefit from the Calendar component is the 'Match Dates' calendar on topcoder.com.  This calendar displays a generic calendar, but also displays links to past, present and future matches.  In addition, the cell formatting is dependent on the match sponsor.  It is these details of a calendar that are managed by the calendar component.   
</P>



<P>
<B>Functional Overview</B>
</P>

<P>
The Calendar component is responsible for the following:
<UL>
	<LI> Providing a generic interface to access customized calendars.</LI>
	<LI> Persisting customized calendar data to a relational database and XML file.</LI>
	<LI> Providing an administration tool to edit the display details of a given date.</LI>
       <UL>
          <LI> A date should be configurable on a past, present and future basis.</LI>
          <LI> Configurable details of a date include:</LI>
             <UL>
                 <LI> Content: The text to display in the calendar cell.</LI>
                 <LI> Hyperlink: The hyperlink to which the cell content or date number is linked.</LI>
                 <LI> GUI Detail  (Ex. Cell Background, CSS class, etc.)</LI>
             </UL>
       </UL>
</UL>
</P>


<P>
<B>Staffing</B>
</P>
 
<P>
The component team will consist of 4 rated TopCoder Members.
</P>

<P>
<B>Architect</B><BR/>
The architect will be responsible for the delivery of a component that meets all specifications as 
defined in the Component Specification and as described by the product manager.  The architect will design 
the solution and manage the deliverables of the developer and the QA developer.  The architect will design 
the solution such that component reuse is maximized.  The architect will be responsible for testing the 
functionality of the component, reviewing and managing deliverables (source code, documentation, schema, etc.) 
and giving final approval to the product manager that the component satisfies the requirements and is implemented correctly.
Responsibilities:
<UL>
	<LI>Design component</LI>
	<LI>Develop Use-Case and class diagrams</LI>
	<LI>Manage Project team through design, development and testing</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>
<B>Developer</B><BR/>
The developer will be responsible for developing a solution that meets all requirements detailed in the 
Component Specification and as specified by the product manager.  The developer's responsibility will 
begin on the project start date and extend through to Production Deployment.  The majority of the 
workload will occur between the project Start Date and completion of QA Testing.  Continued support 
and component modifications may be required through deployment.
</P>

Developer 1: Backend<BR/>
Responsibilities:
<UL>
	<LI>Develop core Calendar component</LI>
	<LI>Develop data access classes for XML and relational data sources</LI>
	<LI>Unit test code</LI>
	<LI>Technologies: Java1.3, JDBC, XML</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Developer 2: Front-end<BR/>
Responsibilities:
<UL>
	<LI>Develop JSP administration tools</LI>
	<LI>Develop component examples</LI>
	<LI>Unit test code</LI>
	<LI>Technologies: Java1.3, HTML, JSP</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>
<B>QA Developer</B><BR/>
The QA Developer is responsible for designing and implementing a test plan from the Component Specification.    
The QA developer is also responsible for testing the completed component.  Tests should involve both normal and 
extreme scenarios to simulate production usage.  The developer's responsibility will begin on the project Start 
Date and extend through to Production Deployment.  In addition to implementing component testing, it 
is also the QA Developer's responsibility to stay abreast of and contribute to the component design and the 
progress of the development.  In the event the lead Developer cannot complete the project, TopCoder Software 
fully expects the QA developer to have sufficient knowledge of the component so as to continue and complete development.

<P>
<B>Payment</B>
</P>

<P>
TopCoder will compensate all team members for their work on the project.  Compensation 
will consist of both initial payments and royalties on the sale of the component.  The 
initial payment will be distributed in three installments: at the start of the project; at 
the completion of the second milestone; and at the completion of the project.  
</P>

<P>
Members will also collect royalties on the revenue generated from the sale of the component.  
This amount is determined using the company royalty pool percentage, currently set as 5% of the 
component's revenue, and the percentage of the developer's contribution to the total contribution 
for the development of the component.  For example if a developer contributes 50% of the work effort 
for a component (is paid 50% of the total member cost of developing the component) that developer 
will receive 50% of the royalty pool for that component.  Royalties may be diluted if additional 
work is done to the component, as the total cost of the component will increase.
