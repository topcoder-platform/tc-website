All source code should be checked into CVS on a daily basis as changes are made. The completion of this phase is marked by the end of development, meaning all source code required for the application is functionally complete and has been checked into CVS. In addition, all automated and manual test cases are written and ready for execution.

All application component source code undergoes testing. All code is reviewed to determine correct interpretation of the design, proper commenting and adherence to coding standards. It is expected that this will be an iterative phase where bug fixes and enhancements are added and regression tested. The result of this phase is a fully functional application or component assembly approved by all members of the development team.

<B>Phase 4: Application Test - Complete January 20, 2003</B>
</P>

<P>
This phase requires the submission of required documentation, source code, test cases, examples and supporting materials. QA Test will retest the application components from a fresh build and in a new installation. No functional errors or design flaws should pass through to this phase. Should any subsequent development be necessary, the project will go back to the Quality Assurance Test phase until the problems have been resolved. TopCoder's internal QA team will evaluate the application components and the test cases. At this time the code may also undergo user acceptance testing.
