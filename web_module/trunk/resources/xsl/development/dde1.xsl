                                    <BR/>
<P>
<B>Overview</B>
</P>

<P>
The TopCoder Distributed Development Environment (DDE) is a software product that enables the building of components and component-based software in a distributed environment.  The purpose of DDE is to enable the development and assembly of reusable software assets. The DDE is not platform specific.  The only requirement is that reuse be a goal for all development efforts. 
</P>

<P>
The software industry has failed to drive the adoption of reuse.  The main reasons why the industry failed are because of inferior software and more importantly, it lacked accepted industry standards, such as Web Services and J2EE.
</P>

<P>
The purpose of this project is to assemble a team of architects to design the DDE, which will happen in the two phases described below.  The implementation of phase 1 will begin immediately following this design project.  The deliverables of the design project will be to determine the scope, timeline and specific deliverables for the implementation of the DDE.
</P>

<P>
<B>Functional Overview</B>
</P>

<P>
The DDE provides a framework for developing component-based software.  A development organization can manage its own reusable assets inside the DDE as well as pull in assets from other organizations using the DDE and TopCoder Software directly.  Development organizations that use the DDE along with the TopCoder Software Distributed Development Methodology will receive maximum benefit.  The Distributed Development Methodology is an iterative development process that leads developers through a number of phases / deliverables, all the way from specification to deployment.  The deliverables include UML diagrams, documentation, commented source code, code reviews, QA rating and of course, detailed software specifications.  These deliverables allow for a robust and optimally functioning DDE.  
</P>

<P>
The DDE promotes the reuse of software by providing strong search functionality over a component catalog, component documentation, examples / demos and API's. The DDE assists developers in the selection of complimentary components to build component bundles (applications) from the component catalog.  Where no component is found, the DDE will start a component collaboration session to define the requirements for a component.  
</P>

<P>
Following is the scope of the DDE project, split into Phase 1 and Phase 2:
</P>

<P>
<B>Phase 1</B><BR/>
<UL>
	<LI>Component Catalog - The Component Catalog is a repository to manage all software assets within one or many organizations.  The catalog will contain all information relating to a component, component project, users, cost, and pricing.  All components will be part of one or many component categories (i.e. infrastructure, retail, biotech).<BR/><BR/></LI>
	<LI>Component Collaborator - A place for users and developers to make suggestions on new components or enhancements to existing components.  If a component is already in specification or development, then a user can apply to participate in the process or begin collaboration on the next phase of the component.<BR/><BR/></LI>
	<LI>Specification Design Center - Once new components are identified and approved in the Component Collaborator, the process moves the idea to the Specification Design Center where formal requirements are gathered from participating / invited members of the user group.  The Specification Design Center assists the group in document collaboration; document management, meeting scheduling and information sharing through eitherchat or a newsgroup type of interface.<BR/><BR/></LI>
	<LI>Component Showroom - Provides functionality to browse and search the catalog for components, view online demos, read case studies, request information, view documentation and API specifications, and download components.  An extension of this component will be developed for TopCoder Software to allow the purchasing of components.</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<P>
<B>Phase 2</B><BR/>
<UL>
	<LI>Software Design Center - Once a component is properly specified, the Software Design Center will provide the collaboration and document management facilities to design software.  A development team will use the tool to directly author, review, enhance, comment and collaborate on-line.  This provides a virtual war-room feel where team-members work on a browser based whiteboard to design a system.  The tool assists the group in document collaboration; meeting scheduling and information sharing through either chat or a newsgroup type of interface.<BR/><BR/></LI>
	<LI>Development Management Center - Provides tools to monitor and report on the progress of development projects and the assigned developers.  The Development Management Center also provides information about developers including level, skill set, history, reviews and utilization.  The center provides tools with which to staff projects as well as communicate with developers.  There is an extension of this to provide specific TopCoder Software functionality, such as linking into the TopCoder member database, handling the posting of projects on the website and assisting in communication with members.<BR/><BR/></LI>
	<LI>Component Development Environment (CDE) - CDE provides access to the component catalog through Integrated Development Environment (IDE) interfaces and Web Service (UDDI) interfaces to allow developers / customers to work directly with component packages (executables, examples, documentation, test cases).<BR/><BR/></LI>
	<LI>Test Harness - Evaluates components by running unit tests, load tests, system tests and performance tests on components to deliver metrics such as CPU, IO and Memory usage.  The Test Harness will report on and rank all software that is tested within its framework.<BR/><BR/></LI>
	<LI>Deployment Center - Every component or bundle of components is packaged in a downloadable form.  This may include JAR, Zip, WAR or EAR.  The Deployment Center automates the packaging of the executables, examples, source code, documentation, configuration files, test cases, etc.<BR/><BR/></LI>
	<LI>Web Service Interface - The Web Service interface will allow for asset sharing and collaboration between companies that use the DDE.  The Web Service interface will provide a SOAP API to the following functionality:</LI>
	    <UL>
	 	<LI> Search the Component Catalog</LI>
		<LI> Download components or component information (for the TopCoder Software extension this will include purchasing components)</LI>
		<LI> Contribute specification or design documents</LI>
		<LI> Request the status of projects</LI>
		<LI> Access the TopCoder Test Harness</LI>
	    </UL>
</UL>
</P>

<P>
The Web Services interface will be designed to work with leading IDE vendors to incorporate developing software systems with the DDE Component Catalog.
</P>

<P>
<B>Staffing</B>
</P>
 
<P>
The component team will consist of two rated TopCoder Members.
</P>

<P>
<B>Data Architect</B><BR/>
The data architect will be responsible for the design of the database schemas and the persistence layer that accesses the schemas.  They will provide all necessary methods and operations for the development of components, which require access to the database or other persistent data stores.  The architect will work with the product manager and the software architect to develop a functionally complete database schema, persistence architecture and object model. 
</P>

<P>
Requirements: Database design experience; OO design experience; Java programming experience with JDBC and XML.
</P>


<P>
<B>Software Architect</B><BR/>
The software architect will be responsible for the delivery of a design that meets all specifications as defined in the requirements documentation and as described by the product manager.  The architect will design the solution and will later manage the deliverables pertaining to that solution by the developer and the QA developer in the implementation phase.  The architect will design the solution such that component reuse is maximized.
</P>	

<P>
Requirements: OO design experience; Java programming experience; JSP experience.
</P>

<P>
<B>Deliverables</B>

<B>Payment</B>
</P>

<P>
TopCoder will compensate all team members for their work on the project.  Compensation will consist of both initial payments and royalties on the sale of the component.  The initial payment will be distributed in three installments: at the start of the project; at the completion of the second milestone; and at the completion of the project.  
</P>

<P>
Members will also collect on the revenue generated from the sale of the component.  This amount is determined using the company royalty pool percentage, currently set as 5% of the component's revenue, and the percentage of the developer's contribution to the total contribution for the development of the component.  For example if a developer contributes 50% of the work effort for a component (is paid 50% of the total member cost of developing the component) that developer will receive 50% of the royalty pool for that component.  Royalties may be diluted if additional work is done to the component, as the total cost of the component will increase.
