The TCES extension project part one will put in a place a system that will allow members to provide TCES representatives with information about themselves. 
                                    <BR/>
                                    <BR/>
                                    <b>Overview</b>
                                    <BR/>
                                    <BR/>
There will be a total of five people assigned to the project with positions available for an architect, development and quality assurance.  Each development assignment will undergo four phases.  Phase one is getting up to speed on the project.  Reading through requirements, documentation and providing any insight as to what the over all project will entail.  The first phase will also be used for developers to get acclimated to the development servers and source code control environments.  Phase two is the design phase.  In the design phase the team as a whole will discuss the over all project goals and objectives and come up the different designs for each specific component.  Phase three is the development phase, and the final phase addresses quality assurance and bug fixes.
                                    <BR/>
                                    <BR/>
TopCoder feels very strongly that developers have a big role in creating project requirements.  As a member of this team you are expected to contribute to the design and implementation of various components even if you will not be working on the directly.  TopCoder also mandates that developers provide feedback and give ideas as to how the system should run from an operations standpoint.  Keep in mind you will ultimately be the end user of this system.
                                    <BR/>
                                    <BR/>
                                    <b>Staffing</b>
                                    <BR/>
                                    <BR/>
The component team will consist of four rated TopCoder Members. 
<ul>
<li>One Architect</li>
<li>Three Developers</li>
<li>One QA Developer</li>
</ul>
                                    <b>Architect</b>
                                    <BR/>
                                    <BR/>
The architect will be responsible for the design of software and test cases that meet all requirements as defined in the requirements documentation and as described by the project manager. The architect will design the solution such that component reuse is maximized. The architect will be responsible for testing the functionality of the component, reviewing the deliverables (source code, documentation, schema, etc.) and giving final approval to the project manager that the component satisfies the requirements and is implemented correctly. 
                                    <BR/>
                                    <BR/>
                                    <b>Developer</b>
                                    <BR/>
                                    <BR/>
The developer will be responsible for developing a solution that meets all requirements detailed in this specification and as specified by the project manager. The developer's responsibility will begin on the project start date and extend through to Production Deployment. The majority of the workload will occur between the project Start Date and completion of Beta Testing. Continued support and component modifications may be required through deployment. 
                                    <BR/>
                                    <BR/>
                                    <b>QA Developer</b>
                                    <BR/>
                                    <BR/>
The QA Developer is responsible for testing the completed component. Tests should involve both normal and extreme scenarios to simulate production usage. The developer's responsibility will begin on the project Start Date and extend through to Production Deployment. The majority of the workload will occur during Beta and QA testing. In addition to implementing component testing, it is also the QA Developer's responsibility to stay abreast of component design and progress. In the event the lead Developer cannot complete the project, TopCoder fully expects the QA developer to have sufficient knowledge of the component so as to continue and complete development.
