                    <p>TopCoder is fast becoming the major league for programming competitions. TopCoder brings members together once a week to compete online 
                    &#40;Single Round Match&#41; and twice a year both online and on location &#40;Tournaments&#41;.</p>
                    
                    <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Why Online Competitions</span><br />
                    Competitions provide an understanding of a person's capabilities through a demonstration of skill. What was lacking in the world of programming 
                    competitions was a format that offered immediate and objective scoring. The solution was the creation of a "Single Round Match".</p>
                    
                    <p>In order to drive repeated participation, TopCoder developed "Tournaments" that offer larger cash prizes to the members who successfully code their 
                    way through weekly Single Round Matches and build a rating that puts them in a seeding for either the Invitational Tournament (open to all members) 
                    or Collegiate Challenge (open to college students only).</p>
                    
                    <p><span class="bodySubtitle">How Members Benefit</span></p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><A href="/?t=about_tc&amp;c=membr_whyjoin"><strong>Competition</strong></A><br />
                        Each Single Round Match offers a fun, time-based, and challenging set of problems that put a developer's skills to the test. This, coupled 
                        with <A href="/index?t=about_tc&amp;c=membr_divisions">Divisions,</A> offer a more level 
                        field of competition for newer members in order to build ratings and move into potential 
                        <A href="/index?t=tournaments&amp;c=tourny_index">Tournament</A> opportunities.</li><br />
                    
                        <li><A href="/?t=development&amp;c=index"><strong>Development</strong></A><br />
                        Rated TopCoder members are eligible to participate in TopCoder Component Development. Members submit design and development solutions 
                        for these challenging and potentially lucrative projects. Winning solutions are rewarded with cash payouts and royalties. For every 
                        commercial sale, TopCoder will pay the members who designed and developed the component a percentage of the sale. </li><br />

                        The market for developers is either feast or famine. Regardless of how many developers there are or how many are available, 
                        the issue remains the same&#151;how to determine which candidate is best suited to the needs of your organization. While 
                        certification has offered some credibility, competitions that test a developer's skills in real-world challenges goes much 
                        further to differentiating one candidate from another.</li>

                        <li><A><xsl:attribute name="href">http://<xsl:value-of select="/TC/SoftwareHost"/>/index.jsp</xsl:attribute><strong>Software</strong></A><br />
                        The best way to drive down the cost of software development is through re-use. The <A><xsl:attribute name="href">http://<xsl:value-of select="/TC/SoftwareHost"/>/components/index.jsp</xsl:attribute>Component Catalog</A>
                        is a tool for increasing re-use and developer productivity within an organization. The component catalog continues to grow on a weekly basis as component 
                        requirements are generated through requests from catalog customers, research from TopCoder Product Managers and from application development.</li><br />
                    
                        <li><A><xsl:attribute name="href">http://<xsl:value-of select="/TC/CorpHost"/>/?module=Static&amp;d1=corp&amp;d2=spon_prog&amp;d3=index</xsl:attribute><strong>Sponsorship</strong></A><br />
                        Reaching the developer community is a difficult task at best. Marketing budgets are limited and with the advent of the Internet, 
                        the expectation for measuring results has only grown. TopCoder offers companies a means of targeting this desired community 
                        through the targeted sponsorship of Single Round Matches
                        and <A><xsl:attribute name="href">http://<xsl:value-of select="/TC/CorpHost"/>/?module=Static&amp;d1=corp&amp;d2=spon_prog&amp;d3=tourny_index</xsl:attribute>Tournaments.</A></li><br />
