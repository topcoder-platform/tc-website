								<p><strong>Why is it that there always seems too much work to do?  Why do we always seem to be waiting?  Waiting for someone to finish before we can move on?  Why is it that, even with all of the new tools, processes and methods, the list of things to do grows faster than what gets done?  Why is is that, no matter how hard we try - how much resource we add (and the cost that goes with it), users, customers and management never seem to be satisfied?</strong><br />
                                  <br />
                                  Enterprise IT today faces serious challenges.  With the explosion of information within and external to the enterprise, resource constrained IT has an increasingly difficult time keeping up with user requests.  Whether implementing and supporting enterprise class applications or responding to changes in existing systems or new technologies, resource constraints create contentious relationships with IT consumers as the organization tries to keep up.  There never seems to be enough money or resource to keep up with demand.  The net result is business functions that never seem to make the priority list, further adding to the frustration.<br />
                                  <br />
                                  <strong>In the internet age, shouldn't there be a better way? </strong><br />
                                  <br />
                                  TopCoder is a new paradigm in meeting the needs of users.  TopCoder is the first massively parallel, <strong>non-labor based</strong> end-to-end solution for the development of all things digital.  No matter how big or small the project, from requirements discovery to design, build and test for applications ranging from small web, mobile and internal departmental apps to large ERP, CRM and decision support development and implementation, TopCoder is a platform that provides instant access to a wealth of resource.  Through parallelization, competition and a deliverables based platform, IT drives the outcome instead of managing resources.  The TopCoder platform allows the enterprise to reach levels of reliability and quality that simply were not possible even a few years ago.  No longer constrained by <em>who</em> is doing the work, but able to focus on <em>what</em> is being accomplished, IT is freed to focus on adding real business value.  It's massive horsepower for the enterprise that <strong>you</strong> control.<br />
                                  <br />
                                You will see no talk of hours and rates here.  All pricing is by the deliverable.  Most importantly, that pricing is set by you.  Need to flesh out an idea,  graphic for a web page,  a new section of the web site or an entirely new web presence integrated to your supply chain and customer relationship system, the TopCoder platform can be plugged in to add scale to any problem - big or small.  It's the world at your fingertips.</p>

							<h2><img src="/i/the_topcoder_methodology.png" width="284" height="27" alt="The TopCoder Methodology" /></h2>			
							<h3>How will this Global Community build my application?</h3>
							<p>Through this methodology, you have a consistent and clear mechanism to utilize the TopCoder Platform. We provide a distinct set of contests and tools to define the specific deliverables for your project, which are then presented to the TopCoder community through various competition types.</p>
							<p>The phases and competitions may be used in series from start to finish, individually or in creative combinations to complete your tasks in the most effective way possible.</p>
							<h3>The Process</h3>
							<div class="process">
								<h4 class="red"><img src="/i/specification.png" alt="Specification" class="app-icon" />Specification</h4>
								<p>Your application requirements are defined using standard UML, prototyping, written specifi cations and test plans. Like every phase of the TopCoder Methodology, outputs of the specifi cation process are peer reviewed and scored to ensure completeness and quality. Creating prototypes up front helps our clients visualize the look and feel of the application early and saves valuable time later in the process.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="process">
								<h4 class="red"><img src="/i/application_architecture.png" alt="Application Architecture" class="app-icon" />Application Architecture</h4>
								<p>The architecture of the application is defined using standard UML and Architecture Competitions. The application is broken down into a component-based architecture, relevant pre-built catalog components are identified and component specifi cations are developed for Component Production.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="process">
								<h4 class="red"><img src="/i/component_production.png" alt="Component Production" class="app-icon" />Component Production</h4>
								<p>The heart of the TopCoder methodology is component production. Each professionally packaged, high quality software component is produced as the result of Component Design, Component Development and Component Testing Competitions. Components fall into one of two categories: catalog or custom. Catalog components are generic and are added to the TopCoder Component Catalog whereas custom components become the intellectual property of the client.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="process">
								<h4 class="red"><img src="/i/assembly.png" alt="Assembly" class="app-icon" />Assembly</h4>
								<p>The assembly of your application comes through a series of competitions as well. First the components are assembled into functioning modules, then the modules into full applications. In many cases, groups of developers form within the community to compete collaboratively as teams.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="process">
								<h4 class="red"><img src="/i/certification.png" alt="Certification" class="app-icon" />Certification</h4>
								<p>This phase uses testing competitions to test and certify application functionality based on requirements. Certifi cation also leverages Bug Races to address component and application code issues.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="process">
								<h4 class="red"><img src="/i/deployment.png" alt="Deployment" class="app-icon" />Deployment</h4>
								<p>The last phase of The TopCoder Methodology results in the deployment and testing of the fi nal deliverables in the target environment. This is where the very best results from multiple competitions and competitors from around the world get delivered to your organization!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
							</div>
							<h3>The Value</h3>
							<p>Centered on software best practices and proven engineering and manufacturing disciplines from a variety of industries, the TopCoder Methodology</p>
							<ul class="methodology_list">
								<li>Delivers quality through measurable performance reviews of all work product via an online scorecard system and automated peer review process</li>
								<li>Provides formal and consistent documentation for every work product delivered, meaning complete traceability from requirements through final deliverables</li>
								<li>Promotes speed and scalability through parallel competitions and a growing virtual community</li>
								<li>Incorporates constant measurement and analytics to ensure you are always making well educated decisions</li>
							</ul>
