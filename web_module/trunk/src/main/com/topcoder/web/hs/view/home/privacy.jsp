            <P><B>PRIVACY POLICY</B></P>

<P>Because we value privacy as much as we value programmers, TopCoder is committed to protecting the privacy of our users.  We want to provide a safe, secure user experience.  We will use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private.  Your personal information is immediately transferred from our web server to behind our firewall, where it remains isolated from a direct connection to the Internet.</P>

<P>Our security and Privacy Commitment are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary.  However, you should understand that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.  The information that you submit to us is used only for the purposes as set forth herein, as required by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is legally required to protect our rights.  We will not use your personal information for any other purpose other than as set out here without first obtaining your permission.  The following reflects our commitment to you.</P>

<P><B>Information About All TopCoder Visitors</B><BR>
We gather information about all of our users collectively, including (a) what area users visit most frequently, (b) their Internet domain and their computer's IP address, (c) the type of browser and operating system they use and (d) if the user linked to our Web site from another Web site, the address of that other Web site.  This information does not in any way personally identify a user; we only use this data anonymously and in the aggregate.  We use this information to analyze trends and statistics to help us improve our services, plan site enhancements and measure overall site effectiveness.  From time to time we may reveal general, anonymous, aggregated statistical information about our site, services and users, such as the number of visits and users and what site features they use.</P>

<P><B>Information About You Specifically</B><BR>
If you choose to register as a member in order to participate in TopCoder High School competitions, you will provide us with additional information about yourself, including name, email address and high school. If you are a winner in a competition and / or tournament, we may also request your address and date of birth.  In addition, if you are a U.S. person (including U.S resident aliens), we will request your social security number (or taxpayer identification number) on IRS form W-9.  If you are a winner, and you are not a U.S person, we will request a Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding on IRS form W-8BEN.  We use this information to verify your eligibility to participate in specific tournaments, and to contact you and properly notify the IRS should you be a winner.  From time to time, we may use the contact information to alert members of new competitions and communicate news, events and reminders.  If you do not want to be alerted of any of these items, you can send us an e-mail at <A HREF="mailto:service@topcoder.com">service@topcoder.com</A> asking to be removed as a member of TopCoder High School.  During competition, users participating will be shown and identified only by their handles, which are their public login names.  A TopCoder High School member's handle, rating, date registered, winnings to date, skill set, and personal quote will be publicly available to any participants of the TopCoder High School web site and competition applications.</P>

<P>Spectators are allowed to view the competition by simply logging into the competition applet with their TopCoder High School handle.  Competition participants must be members and must login to prove it.  All source code created during the competition will be available to anyone - spectators, members and sponsors and may be subject to challenge from other members.  Your performance in a competition will allow us to help balance the competition.  It will be recorded to calculate competition rating values and it will be posted on the web site and in the competition area.  Winners' names may also be released to governmental authorities as required by law and to those requesting such information from TopCoder.  </P>

<P>Only TopCoder will have access to view your demographic information and contact information.</P>

<P>The personal information you provide must be accurate and complete and all registration details (where applicable) must contain your real name, address and other requested details. You are solely responsible for your personal information and we may take any action with respect to your personal information we deem necessary or appropriate if we believe it may cause us to suffer any loss, liability or commercial damage.</P>
