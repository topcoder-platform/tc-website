                        <h3>The Connecticut Association of Schools (C.A.S.)</h3>

                        <p>Unique among the fifty state associations functioning within our national borders, the Connecticut Association of Schools 
                        (formerly the Connecticut Association of Secondary Schools) was created in 1953 through the merger of the Connecticut 
                        Association of Secondary School Principals and the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference. Why unique? Because 
                        unlike most states which have one association devoted to professional programs for principals and another devoted to athletic 
                        and extra-curricular activities for students, CAS is a single organization serving schools, their students and staff, in all 
                        areas of operation.</p>

                        <p>CAS is a non-profit, tax-exempt educational organization. It is affiliated with the National Federation of State High 
                        School Associations (NFHS), the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP), the National Middle School 
                        Association (NMSA), and the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP).</p>

                        <p>In July 2000, CAS completed a historic merger with the Elementary and Middle School Principals' Association of 
                        Connecticut (EMSPAC), a non-profit organization serving CT's elementary and middle school principals. By creating a single 
                        principals' organization and bringing all schools under one umbrella, the merger allowed CAS to achieve the following:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>to present a united voice for all administrators in Connecticut; </li>
                            <li>to create a stronger voice on legislative and public policy issues; </li>
                            <li>to promote K-12 understanding; </li>
                            <li>to broaden its network and reach out to more members; </li>
                            <li>to improve and expand services using the combined resources of two organizations;</li>
                            <li>to develop new services for administrators.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>CAS has emerged as an informed leader in Connecticut's education system, providing services to Connecticut's K-12 
                        schools in areas ranging from academics to athletics.  Today, the Association has grown to represent well over 1,100 of 
                        Connecticut's public and parochial schools. <a href="http://www.casciac.org" target="_blank">Click Here</a>  to visit
