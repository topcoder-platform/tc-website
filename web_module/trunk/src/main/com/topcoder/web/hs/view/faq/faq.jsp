                        TopCoder is a commercial endeavor; we need to make money to keep running.  We plan to make money from corporate sponsors

                        Jack Hughes, a fellow programmer, came up with the idea for TopCoder.<br>
                        <a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>

                        <p><strong>Do you really think this is a good way to measure the relative merit of programmers?</strong></a><br>
                        The ability to quickly code solutions to a set of somewhat simple algorithmic problems does not completely define a "top" 
                        programmer. However, our attempt to make TopCoder competitions as objective as possible has initially lead us in this 
                        direction.  We continuously discuss ways in which we might introduce code elegance, style, reusability, and other less 
                        objectively ratable elements into our tournaments.<br>

                        The coder.  Our Terms of Use agreement basically specifies that the coder who submits any source code to TopCoder High 
                        School owns the code.  We simply require that we can display the source code for the normal course of the competitions 
                        and within the practice rooms.  The actual source code is viewable during certain parts of the competition to competitors 
                        and spectators. You can read the complete <a href="?module=Static&d1=home&d2=terms">Terms of Use.</a><br>

                        If you have not already registered as a TopCoder member, you will need to do so first.  Prior to each match, TopCoder has a match 
                        registration period during which you will need to log into the TopCoder applet (using the your TopCoder handle and password), 
                        and choose Main / Event Registration from the menu.  You may need to answer a brief survey question and accept the terms of the 
                        match.  If you do not go through this process prior to a match, you will not be assigned to a competition room come match time. <br>

                        compete?</strong></a><br>
                        Unfortunately, we cannot allow anyone to compete in a match that they did not register for.  This is due to the formula that is used 
                        to calculate the room assignments.  Once the room assignments have been determined, adding any coder to a room will throw off 
                        the balance of all of the room distributions for that division.  This simply would not be fair.<br>

                        No.  TopCoder's system will remember that you have registered for the event even if you log out after you've registered.<br>

                        The majority of the time, each coder is given 75 minutes to code, a five minute intermission, and 15 minutes to challenge.  After 
                        the challenge portion of the competition has ended, the system testing phase will begin.  The system testing phase is non-interactive,

                        is one of them).  The fix is to replace the "font.properties" file with the following: <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/font.properties" target="_blank">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/font.properties</a><br>

                        TopCoder submissions typically consist of a single class definition.  For each test, one instance of the class is constructed; then 
                        the method described in the problem is called with the test arguments.  Therefore, your method must be public, and your class 
                        must be instantiable: public default constructor, no abstract methods, etc.</p>

                        <p>C++ submissions may also define other classes and global variables or functions.  However, defining main() will prevent 
                        your submission from linking, and referring to library globals (stdout or cout for example) before your method is called is 
                        not guaranteed to work as expected.</p>

                        <p>Each C++ test is performed in a separate process.  The instance of your class used by the tester is not guaranteed to be 
                        destroyed.  The process is forcibly terminated after consuming 8 seconds of CPU time.  At most 64 megabytes of memory may be 
                        mapped.  Stack space is limited to 8 megabytes (the Linux default).  Most system calls are emulated or ignored.  Note especially 
                        that fork() or use of threads (library or kernel) will fail, and use of temporary files is not permitted.</p>

                        <p>If your method does not return before the process exits (due to exceeding the time limit, an uncaught exception, 
                        segmentation fault, divide by zero, etc), it has failed the test.</p>

                        <p>If your method does return a value, that is the only basis for judging correctness.  Anything printed to stdout or stderr is 
                        ignored, although you will see it when testing your own code.  Output may even return an IO error, and takes extra time during 
                        testing; you are advised not to leave unnecessary IO in your final submission.<br>

                        The upgrade to GCC 3.1 may require some changes to C++ submissions to make them conform to standards that weren't implemented 
                        prior to 3.x, but are now enforced:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Everything in the C++ standard library (a.k.a. Standard Template Library or STL) is declared in the namespace std; previously they
                            were all declared globally.  The most convenient way to use standard library symbols is to add the declaration "using namespace std;"
                            before any code that uses identifiers from the library.</li>

                            <li>It is also possible to simply prefix every affected identifier with "std::"; e.g. "std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; d;" or "r=std::max(r,x);".
                            Or only a few select symbols can be imported into the global scope with a directive like "using std::string;" or "using std::find;".</li>

                            <li>Make sure that you really do include all the headers you use. Previously certain library headers would include other headers
                            (e.g. &lt;algorithm&gt; would pull in &lt;iostream&gt;), but the new gcc is somewhat tidier about such things.</li>

                            <li>Non-standard library extensions present with the old GCC may no longer be available; for details see the library documentation at
                            <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc%2B%2B/libstdc%2B%2B-html-USERS-3.1" target="_blank">gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/libstdc++-html-USERS-3.1</a></li>

                        Integer types on our platform:<br>
                        char - 8 bits (signed)<br>
                        short - 16 bits<br>

                        long long - 64 bits</p>
                        
                        <p>long long is not merely a gcc extension, but part of ISO C99.</p>

                        <p>If you test locally with a compiler other than gcc, the preprocessor may be useful for hiding the differences. For example:</p>

                        <p>#ifdef __GNUC__<br>
                        #define int64 long long<br>
                        #else /* MSVC, say */<br>
                        #define int64 __int64<br>
                        #endif</p>

                        <p>In this way, you can test the same code using 64 bit integers in our environment and on your system.</p>

                        <p><strong>I tried loading the Arena through the JWS link and I'm getting an error when JWS is running that 
                        the applet cannot be loaded.</strong></a><br>
                        JWS on OSX has a tendency to cache past loading of the applet. If you did try to load the applet with a previous version of JWS or 
                        continue to have problems, open JWS and select "Preferences". You will see a field for "Application Folder Options". In this you 
                        will see a reference to /Users/you/.javaws/cache. Click on "Clear Folder" to remove the cache. Return to TopCoder.com and click 
                        on the JWS link. The applet should now load (assuming you are running OSX 10.1).<br>

                        <p><strong>How do I copy and paste in the Arena when using Mac OSX?</strong></a><br>
                        Although many Mac users commonly use command-C and command-V to copy and paste, you must use ctrl-C and ctrl-V to copy and 
                        paste from within the Arena.<br>
