                        <p><strong>What do I need to install to run the TopCoder Competition Arena?</strong><br>
                        The online tournament rounds run in a Java applet. We have designed our utilities to utilize some of the features
                        of Sun's 1.2 version of the JDK. This means that in order to run the applet, you will need to install a web
                        browser plug-in that allows the browser to run 1.2 applications. <a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/install.html">Find out</a> 
                        which browser and operating systems are compatible with the plug-in.
                        
                        <p>Even if you already have a JRE 1.1.X plug-in installed, you will need to re-install a newer version of the plug-in.
                        The latest version of the plug-in can be downloaded from <a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/">Sun's web site.</a> 
                        If you have the Sun 1.3 or 1.4 JRE or JDK installed on your machine, you already have the plug-in software
                        installed. Remember, you must install a plug-in that at least supports the Java 1.2 runtime environment.</p>
                        
                        <p>We recommend installing the 1.4 environment, which is the most current version available. Once the plug-in
                        (or the 1.3/1.4 environment) has been downloaded and installed, you will not need to perform these steps in
                        the future. The download for the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) version 1.3, which includes the plug-in
                        software, is around 10MB. This means the download may take some time to complete.</p>
                        
                        <p>Remember, this download only needs to be completed once. Completing the previous steps will also satisfy all 
                        prerequisites in order to run the Competition Arena from within your browser.  Installing the 1.3/1.4 Java Runtime
                        will also allow you to run the TopCoder competition Arena from within Java Web Start (although Java
                        Web Start will need to be installed separately).</p>
                        
                        <p>If you have the necessary software loaded,

<script type="text/javascript">
function arena() {
  w=window.open("","Launch","top=2,left=2,width=300,height=225,status=1");
  d = w.document;
  d.write ( "<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Loading</title>" );
  d.write ( "</head><body bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\">" );
  d.write ( "<font color=\"#000000\" size=\"2\" face=\"arial,verdana,helvetica,sans-serif\">" );

  d.write ( "</body></html>" );
}
