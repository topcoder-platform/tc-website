<P><B>FOR MEMBERS</B><BR>
TopCoder High School competitions are designed for those academically inclined students already interested in computer science.  The key to the competition process is the immediacy and objectivity of each match.  During a TopCoder High School match, competitors do not wait for results or an announcement of winners from a panel of judges that can take days or even weeks to arrive at a decision.  Each TopCoder High School match ends with a System Test Phase and competition results are posted immediately.</P>
<P>
Each contest is simple. In each match, three problem statements with ascending point values are presented. The coder to submit the most accurate solution in the shortest amount of time is awarded the most potential points. The key is that a coder's submission is challenged not only by the TopCoder system, but first by the other participating coders in the match. A coder's entire potential point base (and possible win) can be altered should another coder find a means of "breaking" the submission. </P>

<P><B>Points and Ratings</B><BR>
The more a coder competes, the better their rating can become. Ratings are the key determining factor for establishing the competition field for the High School Tournament to be held at the end of the regular season.  Each coder's rating is based on several factors, but the basic idea is that ratings are based upon the points gained in a given match, the number of matches competed in, and how that stacks up against other coders with similar points and matches.
<P>
As you look through the site, you will see color coding with member's handles. These colors indicate the rating level of that member. Participating members (those who compete versus spectate) are able to view each other's profiles, past code submissions, statistics and more.</p>
<P>

                        <!--TopCoder HighSchool is fast becoming the major league for programming competitions. TopCoder brings members together once a week to compete online (Single Round Match) and twice a year both online and on location (Tournaments).</P>

<P><B>Why Online Competitions</B><BR>
Competitions provide an understanding of a person's capabilities through a demonstration of skill. What was lacking in the world of programming competitions was a format that offered immediate and objective scoring. The solution was the creation of a "Single Round Match".</P>

<P>In order to drive repeated participation, TopCoder developed "Tournaments" that offer larger cash prizes to the members who successfully code their way through weekly Single Round Matches and build a rating that puts them in a seeding for either the Invitational Tournament (open to all members) or Collegiate Challenge (open to college students only).</P>

<P><B>Who Benefits</B></P>

<P><B>Members</B><BR>
Each Single Round Match offers a fun, time-based, and challenging set of problems that put a developer's skills to the test. TopCoder is in the process of establishing Teams. This coupled with the new Divisions will offer a more level field of competition for newer members in order to build ratings and move into potential tournament opportunities.</P>


<P><B>Sponsors</B>
Reaching the developer community is a difficult task at best. Marketing budgets are limited and with the advent of the Internet, the expectation for measuring results has only grown. TopCoder offers companies a means of targeting this desired community through the targeted sponsorship of Single Round Matches and Tournaments.</P>-->
