                        The 2003 TopCoder High School tournament will take place on May 20, 2003.  It will consist of one (1) onsite round 
                        being held at the University of Connecticut's Storrs campus ("UCONN").  The top performing 10 schools, as determined 
                        during the regular season, will be invited to advance to the onsite Championship round.  Each school will appoint three (3) 
                        competitors to represent their school at the finals.</p>

                        <p><font size="3"><strong>Eligibility</strong></font><br>
                        The tournament is open to the CT high schools who have participated in at least four (4) of the eight (8) TopCoder High 
                        School rated events held during the regular season (March 20 - May 8, 2003).  In order to be invited to the playoffs, a 
                        high school must have competed in at least 4 "scored" rounds. This means that they must have had at least 4 rounds in 
                        which they had at least 3 students competing. The highest ranked schools at the end of the regular season will be invited 
                        to the playoffs. A high school's rank will be determined by the average of that high school's best 4 scores.</p>
