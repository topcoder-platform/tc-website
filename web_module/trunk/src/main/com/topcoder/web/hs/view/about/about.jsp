                        TopCoder, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, launched TopCoder High School in December 2002.  Through its partnership with the Connecticut Association of Schools (CAS), TopCoder hosts competitions for Connecticut high schools students and provides the means for these academically inclined students to showcase their skills alongside classmates during statewide team competition.  The TopCoder High School regular season will commence in March 2003 and will culminate in May 2003 with a statewide championship competition between the best computer science high schools in Connecticut. </P>

<P><B>FOR MEMBERS</B><BR>
TopCoder High School competitions are designed for those academically inclined students already interested in computer science.  The key to the competition process is the immediacy and objectivity of each match.  During a TopCoder High School match, competitors do not wait for results or an announcement of winners from a panel of judges that can take days or even weeks to arrive at a decision.  Each TopCoder High School match ends with a System Test Phase and competition results are posted immediately. <A HREF="?module=Static&d1=about&d2=about_member"><B>more&gt;&gt;</B></A></P>



<P><B>FOR SPONSORS</B><BR>
TopCoder High School provides sponsoring companies the ability to proactively and directly support and promote high school math and science programs within their communities.  It also allows companies to reach a desirable and targeted market of high school consumers and their families.  Sponsorship of these academically competitive events may further position a company as a leader in the community and provide benefit to those students who previously had no "playing field" to showcase their skills. <A HREF="?module=Static&d1=about&d2=about_sponsor"><B>more&gt;&gt;</B></A></P>



             <P><BR></P>


                        <!--TopCoder HighSchool is fast becoming the major league for programming competitions. TopCoder brings members together once a week to compete online (Single Round Match) and twice a year both online and on location (Tournaments).</P>

<P><B>Why Online Competitions</B><BR>
Competitions provide an understanding of a person's capabilities through a demonstration of skill. What was lacking in the world of programming competitions was a format that offered immediate and objective scoring. The solution was the creation of a "Single Round Match".</P>

<P>In order to drive repeated participation, TopCoder developed "Tournaments" that offer larger cash prizes to the members who successfully code their way through weekly Single Round Matches and build a rating that puts them in a seeding for either the Invitational Tournament (open to all members) or Collegiate Challenge (open to college students only).</P>

<P><B>Who Benefits</B></P>

<P><B>Members</B><BR>
Each Single Round Match offers a fun, time-based, and challenging set of problems that put a developer's skills to the test. TopCoder is in the process of establishing Teams. This coupled with the new Divisions will offer a more level field of competition for newer members in order to build ratings and move into potential tournament opportunities.</P>


<P><B>Sponsors</B>
Reaching the developer community is a difficult task at best. Marketing budgets are limited and with the advent of the Internet, the expectation for measuring results has only grown. TopCoder offers companies a means of targeting this desired community through the targeted sponsorship of Single Round Matches and Tournaments.</P>-->
