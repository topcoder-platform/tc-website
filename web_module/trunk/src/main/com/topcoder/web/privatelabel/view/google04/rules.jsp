Google&#153; Code Jam 2004, Powered by TopCoder&#174;
Official Rules and Regulations

<span class=bigRed>No purchase necessary to enter or win.  The tournament is void where prohibited</span>

<span class=greenSubtitle>Summary of the Tournament</span>
The Google&#153; Code Jam 2004 is being offered by Google Inc. ("Google") and TopCoder, Inc. ("TopCoder").  Google is using the results of the Code Jam 2004 to identify possible employees for their company.  The Code Jam 2004 will take place between Wednesday, September 1 and Friday, October 15, 2004.  It begins with a 2-week online registration, after which all registered individuals will participate in a Qualification Round to determine who will compete in the programming tournament.  The tournament consists of one (1) day of qualification, two (2) online elimination rounds and one (1) onsite final round.  All participants who compete in Round 1 (the first online elimination round) will receive a Google Code Jam 2004, Powered by TopCoder t-shirt.  In addition, Google will award $30,000 in cash prizes to the 50 finalists in the tournament.

Eligibility
All individuals who are 18 years of age or older by September 1, 2004 may register and compete in the Google Code Jam 2004.  

Registrants who are 18 years of age or older are eligible to win cash prizes, unless otherwise prohibited. The Google Code Jam 2004 is void in the Quebec province of Canada, and elsewhere where prohibited by applicable law. Cash prizes will not be paid to residents of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria.

Employees of Google and TopCoder and those involved in the production (including prize suppliers), implementation and distribution of this tournament and their advertising or promotion agencies, parent companies, service providers, agents, officers, subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other persons or entities directly associated with the tournament and members of the immediate families and/or persons living in the same household as such persons, are ineligible to enter the tournament.

Registration
Registration will open on Wednesday, September 1 at 9:00AM ET and will close on Tuesday, September 14 at 6:00PM ET.  Registration is unlimited, however each individual may only register once.

Qualification Round
The Qualification Round will be open for 24 hours from 12:00PM ET Wednesday, September 15 through 12:00PM ET Thursday, September 16, 2004.

The Qualification Round will consist of two phases: the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase.

* The Qualification Round Coding Phase is a timed event where contestants are presented with one of five possible problem sets.  Each problem set contains two questions representing two levels of complexity and, accordingly, two levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.  Competitors will have 60 minutes to complete either or both of the problems.  The 60 minutes will begin to elapse once the first problem is opened.  The timer in the coding window will count down to the end of the 60 minutes.  A competitor who begins the qualification attempt within the final 60 minutes of the Qualification Round will have less than 60 minutes to attempt qualification.

* The Qualification Round System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given question. 

The Qualification Round will contain ten (10) virtual rooms and five (5) problem sets.  The top 100 scorers from each of the five problem sets presented during the Qualification Round will be eligible to compete in Round 1 of the Code Jam 2004. 

The Competition Field
Up to 500 individuals will qualify to compete in Round 1.  The top 250 scorers from Round 1 will advance to Round 2.  The top 50 scorers from Round 2 will advance to the Championship Round, which will be held onsite at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, CA, USA.

The Rounds will be held on the following dates:

<span class=greenSubtitle>About the Tournament</span><br/>
Use of Plugins in the Competition Arena
The use of external TopCoder Arena plugins or any modifications to the TopCoder Arena functionality is strictly prohibited.

Online Elimination Rounds
Everyone who competes in Round 1 must log in to the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than ten minutes prior to the start of the online round.  All start times will be communicated as Eastern Time, so contestants in other time zones must adjust accordingly.  If a coder does not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition. 

All competitors who have been invited to compete will be randomly assigned to specific rooms, with up to 10 people in each room.  TopCoder will determine all room assignments prior to the start of each online round. 

Scoring and Advancing
After each round of competition, the top scorers will be identified and will advance to the next round.  Coder advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round (see Competition Round Structure) for each coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater-than-zero) point total. The structure of the online rounds is as follows:

Round 1 (online)
* Up to 500 coders will compete in Round 1 and up to 250 will advance.  The 250 highest scoring competitors will advance to Round 2.  Each coder must have positive points to advance, so if there are less than 250 competitors who score positive points, only those competitors with a positive point total will advance.  

Round 2 (online)
* Up to 250 coders will compete and up to 50 will advance.  The 50 highest scoring competitors will advance to the Championship Round.  Each coder must have positive points to advance, so if there are less than 50 competitors who score positive points, only those competitors with a positive point total will advance.

NOTE:  In the event of a tie for any advancing position, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:

o Total points acquired (higher is better) during the previous rounds of the tournament, excluding the Qualification Round 
o If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round

Competition Round Structure
Each online and onsite round of competition (excluding the Qualification Round) consists of three phases: the Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. The Qualification Round will consist only of the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase.  (See "Qualification Round" above for details regarding the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase of the Qualification Round.)

* The Coding Phase is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.

* The Challenge Phase is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 50 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition. 

* The System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.

Onsite Championship Round
The 50 advancers from Round 2 will travel to Google’s headquarters to compete in the Championship Round of the tournament being held on Friday, October 15, 2004.  Each finalist must confirm his/her attendance in the Championship Round by September 30, 2004.  If a contestant does not confirm his/her attendance in the Championship Round by said date, he/she will forfeit eligibility to receive a prize, and his/her spot in the tournament will be given to the next highest scorer from Round 2.

Google will provide all travel accommodations for each finalist to attend the Championship Round.  In addition, Google will provide overnight accommodations and all travel arrangements to and from the airport, as well as to and from Google’s headquarters.  All other expenses are the responsibility of the contestant.   

TopCoder will determine the room assignments for the Championship Round prior to the start of the Championship Round. 

The Championship Round will be a single round of 50 coders. The first, second, third and fourth place finishers in the Championship Round are determined by comparing the total points of each coder, with the highest point value placing first. The winner of the Championship Round will be the coder with the highest point total for the round. In the event of a tie in the Championship Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order):

* Total points acquired (higher is better) during online Rounds 1 and 2
* If a tie still remains in the Championship Round, then the prize money will be distributed equally among the tied coders
