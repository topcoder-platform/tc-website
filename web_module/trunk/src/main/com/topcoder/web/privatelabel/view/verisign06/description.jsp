<span class="bigTitle">VeriSign&#174; Internal Coding Competitions</span>
<br/><br/>
Welcome to the 2006 VeriSign Internal Coding Competition! By participating, you can earn cash prizes and a seat at the first-ever VeriSign Technical Symposium (VTS) in Williamsburg, VA from June 11-13.
<br/><br/>
The internal coding competition is only one of the ways we can come together as a technical community.  In the upcoming months, you will receive even more information on the engineering community Web site, which will help all of us: 
<ul>
<li>share information and code</li>
<li>promote the development and use of best practices</li>
<li>facilitate access to and adoption of the Common Application Framework (CAF)*</li>
<li>foster a company-wide engineers' network</li>
</ul>

The VeriSign Internal Coding Competition consists of Single Round Matches (SRM) <b>exclusively for VeriSign employees</b>.  The SRM is a timed contest where participants compete online to solve the same problems under the same time constraints. You can compete in Java, C++, C#, or VB.

<br/><br/>
<span class="bodySubtitle">How a Single Round Match Works:</span><br/>

<b>Download the Arena</b><br/>
Down load the TopCoder&#174; Competition Arena (a Java Applet), read the problem statements, then code solutions, compile and test those solutions, and, finally, submit the code for points. You may download the arena ahead of time to practice on sample problems before the actual competition.
<br/><br/>

<b>Coding Phase</b><br/>
At the designated date and time, competitors enter the Arena and are placed in groups of ten in virtual rooms. All participants are presented with the same set of three problems, which are increasingly difficult. In a race to see who can create an accurate solution in the shortest amount of time, competitors try to out-think and out-code their opponents. The Leader Board tallies the points during the competition. 
<br/><br/>

<b>Challenge Phase</b><br/>
During the Challenge Phase, competitors view their competition's code, as well as try to "break" it by passing test cases through the submitted code, with the hope that the results are not satisfied by the software that was written to solve the problem. Breaking another developer's code is the most form of competition for participants. In this phase, points are awarded for successful challenges and deducted for unsuccessful challenges.
<br/><br/>

<b>System Tests</b><br/>
Within minutes of the end of the Challenge Phase, the automated objective system tests to determine the accuracy of all submissions and award final points to competitors. The assessment of your performance and presentation of stats is nearly instantaneous, as is the gratification of knowing how you did against the competition.
