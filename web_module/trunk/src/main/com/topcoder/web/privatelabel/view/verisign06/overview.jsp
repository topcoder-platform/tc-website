         <p class="blkBigHead">2006 TopCoder Open VeriSign Sponsor Track Competition</p>
        
Welcome to the 2006 TopCoder Open VeriSign Sponsor Track competition--one of many opportunities you will have this year to participate in coding competitions, demonstrate your technology talents, and network with other VeriSign engineers worldwide.
<br/><br/> 
This year, we hope to strengthen our engineering community by finding ways for us to connect with each other, such as: 
<ul>
<li>Sharing information and code</li>
<li>Promoting the development and use of best practices</li>
<li>Facilitating access to and adoption of the Common Application Framework (CAF)*</li>
<li>Fostering a company-wide engineers' network</li>
</ul>
For some fun, we have teamed up with TopCoder to bring you exciting online coding contests with fantastic prizes. 
<br/><br/> 
There are several rounds of competitions planned this year. The final competition will take place this summer at the first ever VeriSign Technical Symposium (VTS). The VTS is a multi-day, multi-track event, at which engineers will meet with industry experts and vendors, exchange ideas, and build relationships with each other.
<br/><br/> 
The first coding competition of the year is the Sponsor Track challenge. Win this, and you will collect $2,500 and become a finalist in our live coding competition at the VTS. Following this Sponsor Track competition, VeriSign will hold two internal competitions. First and second place winners of each will win $1,500 and $750 respectively and become finalists. See the official <a href="/pl/?module=Static&d1=verisign06&d2=rules">rules and regulations</a> for more details.
<br/><br/> 
VeriSign Human Resources, VeriSign Security Services, VeriSign Information Services, Operations & Infrastructure, and the CAF team are sponsoring the Sponsor Track competition. Through this exciting event, VeriSign hopes to spur the next generation of intelligent infrastructure services, enabling and protecting tomorrow's critical interactions. 
<br/><br/> 
Best of luck and let the coding begin! 
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
