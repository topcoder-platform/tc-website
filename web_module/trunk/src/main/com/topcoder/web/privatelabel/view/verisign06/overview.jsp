We're giving employees and interns of the sponsors of the TopCoder Open 2006 a tournament of their own. It's a chance to compete among your peers in the Sponsor Track Competition, open to all employees of companies sponsoring the TCO.  <br><br>
<br>

<span class="redHead">This is how it works:</span>
<br><br>
The tournament is a timed contest where all participants compete online to solve the same problems under the same time constraints.
<br><br>
The competition is available in four programming languages - Java, C++, C#, and VB.
<br/><br/>
Here's the line-by-line documentation:
<br><br>
<div class="indented">
   <b>Download the Arena</b><br/>
   The TopCoder&#174; Competition Arena (a Java Applet) is where you begin. Download the app, read the problem statements, then code solutions, compile and test those solutions and submit the code for points. You can download the arena ahead of time to practice on sample problems prior to the competition.
   <br/><br/>
   <b>Coding Phase</b><br/>
   At the designated date and time, competitors enter the Arena and are placed in groups of ten into virtual rooms. All participants are presented with the same set of three problems of escalating difficulty. In a race to see who can create an accurate solution in the shortest amount of time, competitors try to out-think and out-code their opponents. The Leader Board tallies the points during each step of the competition.
   <br/><br/>
   <b>Challenge Phase</b><br/>
   During the Challenge Phase, competitors view each other's code and try to "break'" that code by passing test cases through the submitted code, with the hope that the results are not satisfied by the software written. Breaking another developer's code is the most direct form of competition for a programmer. In this phase, points are awarded for successful challenges and deducted for unsuccessful challenges.
   <br/><br/>
   <b>System Tests</b><br/>
   Within minutes of the end of the Challenge Phase, the automated, objective system tests determine the accuracy of all submissions and award final points to all competitors. The assessment of your performance and presentation of stats is nearly instantaneous, as is the gratification of knowing how you did against a competitive field.
