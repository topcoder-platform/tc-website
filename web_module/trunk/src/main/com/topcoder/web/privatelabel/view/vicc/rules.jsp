competing. Competitors must be 18 years of age or older as of the date of the SRM in which you compete.
<br /><br />
Employees of TopCoder and those involved in the development, production (including prize suppliers and sponsors),

<span class="bodySubtitle">About the Matches</span>
<br /><br />
<strong>Registering for the Online Single Round Matches</strong><br />
Members must first be registered on the VeriSign Code Fest website by choosing the "Registration" tab above.
<br /><br />
Members must also register for each Single Round Match. Registration is for two (2) hours
and 55 minutes prior to the start of the round. To register, login to the Arena applet (see arena tab above), 
click on the 'Main' menu, and choose the option for 'Registration'. Members from all over the country
will be participating in this event, but <em>all start times will be communicated as Eastern Time, so
    contestants in different time zones must adjust accordingly</em>. All competitors who have registered
for the round will be assigned to a specific room. TopCoder will perform the room assignments prior to
the start of a round.
<br /><br />

<strong>Upon Entering an Online Single Round Match</strong><br />
Each round consists of three phases: the coding phase, challenge phase, and the testing phase. <br />
<ol>
    <li><strong>The Coding Phase</strong> is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three
        questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point
        earnings potential. Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that
        successfully compiles.
    </li>
    <li><strong>The Challenge Phase</strong> is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge
        the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will award 50 points to the
        challenger, and any points gained by the submitter for the problem will be lost. Unsuccessful
        challenges will cost the challenger 25 points as a penalty, applied to their total score in that
        round of competition.
    </li>
    <li><strong>The Automated Testing Phase</strong> is applied to all submitted code that has not already been
        successfully challenged. If TopCoder finds code that is flawed, the author of that code
        submission will lose all of the points they earned for that code submission. The automated
        tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct.
        If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is
        considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code
        submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be
        added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.
    </li>
</ol>


<strong>Scoring During Online Single Round Matches</strong><br />
All contestants, who opened any problem during the round, will have their ratings adjusted up or down to
reflect their performance, based on <a href="/tc?module=Static&d1=help&d2=ratings">TopCoder's rating formula</a>.
Contestant ratings play no role in a
Coder's final standing in the competition room.
<br /><br />

<span class="bodySubtitle">Conditions of Participation</span>
<br /><br />
By participating in the tournament, you agree to be bound by these rules and to all decisions of
TopCoder, which are final, binding and conclusive in all matters.
<br /><br />

<span class="bigRed">Contestants must not cheat. All ideas for code and/or challenge
submitted must be the contestant's alone. TopCoder uses the word "cheat"
to mean collaboration of any sort - including, but not limited to,
working with another competitor, submitting code that was not fully
authored by you, and using resources, software, etc. that are not
allowed in TopCoder competitions. TopCoder reserves the right, in its
sole discretion, to remove any competitor from the tournament who it
suspects has cheated.</span>
<br /><br />
Winners in each round of competition will be those competitors that score the most points in their
respective rooms. All decisions relating to the viability of submissions, the ranking of submissions and
all other matters pertaining to the tournament shall be within the sole discretion of TopCoder or its
designee and shall be final and binding in all respects.
<br /><br />
VeriSign may distribute prizes for each SRM.
