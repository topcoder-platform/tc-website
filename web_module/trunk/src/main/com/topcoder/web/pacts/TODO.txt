have a deleted status for payments

6/5/2002 10:19 pm edt  jason n. evans
the table strucure for payment, payment_detail, payment_address prohibits deletions due to circular
foreign key refrences.  Also if detail records are deleted there is no way to find the relevetn payment_address records.
Also, you cannot delete the payment_detail without deleting the payment_detail_xref, however, you would then loss the
reference to find the detail records.
