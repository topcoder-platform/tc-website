have a deleted status for payments

6/5/2002 10:19 pm edt  jason n. evans
the table strucure for payment, payment_detail, payment_address prohibits deletions due to circular
foreign key refrences.  Also if detail records are deleted there is no way to find the relevetn payment_address records.
Also, you cannot delete the payment_detail without deleting the payment_detail_xref, however, you would then loss the
reference to find the detail records.

Let's say we have a pacts administrator A and a topcoder contestant B.

If A creates an affidavit manually for B without the necessary embedded xml in the affidavit text, when B subsequently
tries to affirm it online, he sees a page "can not get affidavit" - this is a result of xml parsing exceptions
on the server.

Also, note that if A affirms an affidavit online on behalf of B and enters in a date of birth, this updates the
coder table, so B might later on be surprised to find an incorrect birth date in his personal information if A got the
date wrong.
