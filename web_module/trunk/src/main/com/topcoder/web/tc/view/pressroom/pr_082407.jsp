<p><strong>Glastonbury, Conn., August 24, 2007 &#151;</strong>TopCoder&#174;, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, skills assessment and competitive software development, today announced Eli Lilly and Company <strong>(NYSE: LLY)</strong>, and Deutsche Bank <strong>(NYSE: DB)</strong>, a leading global investment bank, as first time sponsors of the 2007 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge scheduled for October 30th - November 2nd at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. In addition, the National Security Agency (NSA) has continued as an event patron for an unprecedented fifth major event. Full details including event schedules, rules and guidelines are available online at: <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tccc07">http://www.topcoder.com/tccc07</a>.</p>

<p>"TopCoder attracts extremely dedicated young people who are capable of analyzing, structuring and solving exceptional problems quickly by working as part of a team," says Wolfgang Gaertner, Head of Personal &amp; Corporate Banking IT and Operations at Deutsche Bank. "These skills are in high demand everywhere in banking. Deutsche Bank has opened its doors widely to such talented people by offering a variety of career development opportunities, creating possibilities for them to prove themselves in numerous interesting fields of work all over the world. For this reason," says Gaertner, "I am very positive about DB's participation in the TopCoder event."</p>

<p>The TCCC07 sponsor track will for the first time offer sponsors more equal billing -- each will be afforded the same opportunities for global branding and interfacing with the TopCoder community and onsite finalists. This year's TCCC features four highly contested tournament tracks -- the Algorithm Competition, Component Design and Development Competition, Marathon Match Competition and Studio Design Competition. More than 3,000 talented competitors registered across all competitions. TopCoder competitions offer sponsors a powerful branding platform within the TopCoder global community of over 120,000 members and provides a unique opportunity to build valuable relationships and to hire some of the best developers in the world.</p>

<p>Thousands of students in computer science, mathematics, physics and other disciplines from universities around the world began registering in July to compete online with the goal of advancing to the world-renowned TCCC onsite finals being held at Disney World in Orlando, Florida this November. Finalists will compete in algorithm, component design and component development divisions to earn a share of more than $220,000 in cash prizes.</p>

<p>"Competition is at the heart of everything we do at TopCoder and that applies to the opportunities we present to our sponsors as well," said Rob Hughes, President and COO of TopCoder, Inc. "We welcome Lilly and Deutsche Bank as newcomers to our onsite events and are pleased to continue our productive relationship with NSA."</p>

<p><span class="bodySubtitle">About TopCoder Competitions</span><br />
TopCoder tournaments are known worldwide as the most grueling, comprehensive test of skill in the field of competitive programming.
