<a href="#top"><img src="/i/navigation/back_to_top.gif" alt="back to top" width="83" height="23" border="0" align="right"></a>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Registration</span><br><br>
Registration for the 2005 TopCoder Open Algorithm Competition will open at 9:00AM EDT on Monday, August 1, 2005, and will close at 9:00AM EDT on Tuesday, August 16, 2005.  In order to be eligible to compete in the Algorithm Competition, competitors must be a registered TopCoder member and have registered separately for the Algorithm Competition.  There is no limit to the number of registrants for the competition, however each individual may only register once.
<br><br>
<a name="qualification"></a>
<strong>Qualification Round - Noon EDT Tuesday, August 16 through Noon EDT Wednesday, August 17, 2005</strong>
<br><br>
The Qualification Round will be open for 24 hours from Noon EDT Tuesday, August 16 through Noon EDT Wednesday, August 17, 2005.  Each competitor may participate in the Qualification Round at any time during the 24 hours.  Competitors may only attempt to qualify one time using one account during the 24 hours.
<br><br>
The Qualification Round will consist of only two phases: the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase.<br><strong>Note: The Qualification Round will not include a Challenge Phase.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Qualification Round Coding Phase is a timed event where contestants are randomly presented with one of five possible problem sets.  Each problem set contains two questions representing two levels of complexity and, accordingly, two levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.  Competitors will have 60 minutes to complete either or both of the problems.  The 60 minutes will begin to elapse once the first problem is opened.  The timer in the coding window will count down to the end of the 60 minutes.  A competitor who begins the qualification attempt within the final 60 minutes of the Qualification Round will have less than 60 minutes to attempt qualification.</li>
<li>The Qualification Round System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code at the conclusion of the Qualification Round. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given question.</li>
</ul>
Upon logging in to the TopCoder Arena during the Qualification Round, each competitor who has registered for the Algorithm Competition will receive a message indicating which set of problems he/she has been assigned.  The highest 150 positive (i.e., greater than zero) scorers from each of the five problem sets presented during the Qualification Round will be eligible to compete in Online Round #1 of the Algorithm Competition.  A maximum of 750 competitors will advance to Online Round #1.  Members will be rated at the conclusion of the Qualification Round based on their performance against others presented with the same problem set.  
<br><br>
NOTE:  In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the Qualification Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:
<ul>
<li>By rating (higher is better) prior to the Qualification Round.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round.</li>
</ul>

<a name="structure"></a>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Online Elimination Rounds</span><br><br>
Everyone who competes in an online round must register for each round in the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than five (5) minutes prior to the start of the online round. TopCoder members from around the world may be participating in the online rounds, but all start times will be communicated as Eastern Daylight Time (GMT -4), so contestants in different time zones must adjust accordingly. If a coder does not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition. 
<br><br>
All competitors who have qualified for an online round will be assigned to a specific room, based on their TopCoder rating after the previous round. TopCoder will determine all room assignments prior to the start of each online round in the TopCoder Iron Man format, which assigns members to rooms according to their rating after the previous round, such that members with the higher ratings are assigned to the lower numbered rooms.   Each room in an online round will be assigned 25 competitors.
<br><br>
The dates and times of the online rounds of competition are as follows:

<span class="bodySubtitle">Scoring and Advancing during Online Rounds</span><br>
After each round of competition, the highest scorers from across all rooms will be identified and will advance to the next online round.  Coder advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round for each coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater-than-zero) point total. The structure of the online rounds is as follows:

<ul>
<li><strong>Online Round #1</strong><br>Up to 750 coders will compete in Round #1 and up to 400 will advance.  The highest 400 scorers across all rooms will advance to Online Round #2.</li>
<li><strong>Online Round #2</strong><br>Up to 400 coders will compete and up to 200 will advance.  The highest 200 scorers across all rooms will advance to Online Round #3.</li>
<li><strong>Online Round #3</strong><br>Up to 200 coders will compete and up to 100 will advance.  The highest 100 scorers across all rooms will advance to Online Round #4.</li>
<li><strong>Online Round #4</strong><br>Up to 100 coders will compete and up to 48 will advance.  The highest 48 scorers across all rooms will advance to the field of Semifinalists.</li>
</ul>
NOTE:  In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the online rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:
<ul>
<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during the previous online rounds of the tournament (excluding the Qualification Round).</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then by rating (higher is better) following the Qualification Round.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round.</li>
</ul>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Round Structure</span><br>
With the exception of the Qualification Round, each online and onsite round of competition consists of three phases: the Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. (Note: The format of these competition rounds is similar to the format of TopCoder Single Round Matches.  The rules in place for the Single Round Matches as of August 16, 2005 will also apply to the online and onsite rounds of the TCO, with the exception of the Unused Code Rule during the onsite rounds.)
<ul>
<li><strong>The Coding Phase</strong> is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened until the time it was submitted.  During the online rounds, the Coding Phase will last 75 minutes.  During the onsite rounds, the Coding Phase will last 85 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenge Phase</strong> is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.  During the online rounds, the Challenge Phase will last 15 minutes.  During the onsite round, the Challenge Phase will last 10 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>The System Testing Phase</strong> is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</li>
</ul>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Onsite Semifinal and Championship Rounds</span><br>
The forty-eight (48) advancers from Online Round #4 will travel to the Santa Clara Marriott on either Tuesday, October 11th or Wednesday, October 12th to compete in the Semifinal round of the tournament being held on Thursday, October 13th.  All contestants must arrive at the Santa Clara Marriott no later than 4:00 PM PDT on Wednesday, October 12th.  All contestants must confirm their attendance at the onsite rounds no later than 5:00 PM EDT on Wednesday, September 21, 2005.  That is, contestants must have acquired any necessary travel visas and know for certain that they can travel to the US by that date and time.  If a contestant is unable to attend the onsite rounds, he/she will forfeit his/her eligibility to receive any prizes awarded to onsite finalists, and his/her spot in the tournament will be given to the next highest overall scorer from Online Round #4.  
<br><br>
TopCoder will provide travel arrangements for each competitor up to a cost of $1,000 per person.  (That is, if a contestant's airfare is greater than $1,000, the difference between the cost of the airfare and $1,000 will be deducted from the contestant's total TCO prize money won.  If the contestant's total TCO prize money is not sufficient to cover the additional costs, the contestant will be responsible for remitting to TopCoder the remainder of the cost.)  TopCoder will also provide ground transportation to and from the airport, as well as hotel accommodations and certain meals for each contestant.  All other expenses are the responsibility of the contestant.  TopCoder will not provide travel or lodging accommodations for competitor guests at the 2005 TCO.  
<br><br>
TopCoder will determine the room assignments for the Semifinal rooms prior to the start of each Semifinal round, in a manner such that the average competitor rating following Online Round #4 for each room will be similar.  The dates and times of the onsite Semifinal and Championship rounds are as follows:

<br><br>	
<strong>The Semifinal Round</strong> will consist of three (3) rooms of sixteen (16) coders each. The two (2) highest scorers in each room will advance to the Championship Round.  The next four (4) highest scorers in each round will participate in one (1) Wildcard Round.  The two (2) highest scorers of the Wildcard Round will also advance to the Championship Round.
<br><br>
<strong>The Championship Round</strong> will be a single round of eight (8) coders. Placement in the Championship round is determined by comparing the total points of each coder, with the highest point value placing first. The winner of the Championship Round will be the coder with the highest point total for the round. In the event of a tie in the Semifinal, Wildcard and/or Championship rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order):

<ul>
<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during Online Rounds #1, #2, #3 and #4 of the 2005 TopCoder Open.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then by rating (higher is better) following Online Round #4.</li>
   <ul>
   <li>If a tie still remains in the Semifinal or Wildcard round, then all tied coders will advance to the Championship Round</li>
   <li>If a tie still remains in the Championship round, then the prize money will be distributed equally amongst the tied coders</li>
   </ul>
