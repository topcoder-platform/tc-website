<%-- EXPERIMENTAL SERIES --%>
<% if (Arrays.binarySearch(experimentalRounds, roundId)>=0) { %>

<p align="justify">
This is the second of a series of Experimental Marathon Matches that TopCoder is running in coordination with Professor 
Karim Lakhani of Harvard Business School and Professor Kevin Boudreau of London Business School/MLab. The structure and 
rules for these events are a departure from anything that TopCoder has run in the past, in that we are exploring the effects of 
collaboration and information sharing during competition.
<br><br>
The second Experimental Marathon Match will include an algorithm problem provided by the Integrated Medical Model Team at NASA . 
In this contest programmers will be asked to help NASA optimize a space flight medical kit  for astronauts. We believe that the 
TopCoder community may have an interesting take on this problem and could potentially come up with a breakthrough that will help 
NASA explore our universe.  
<br><br>
This Experimental Marathon Match event has over <b>$25,000</b> in prizes! In addition, 10 participants will get <b>VIP access</b> 
to one of the few remaining NASA shuttle launches and all contestants who actively participate will receive a limited edition, 
personalized <b>TopCoder/NASA T-shirt</b>.
<br><br>
In this Experimental Marathon Match, members who register for the event will be assigned to a Group, and within the Group 
will compete in sets of 20 individuals.  The total prize for each set will be $1,000.  In one Group, contestants will 
compete as members of teams of 5 against 3 other teams and in the other Group, contestants will compete individually against 
19 other individuals. 
<br><br>
<ul>

<li>
<b>Group A</b> - <i>Traditional Marathon Match</i> - Individuals in this group will be assigned to work on the problem individually 
- i.e. no information sharing at all. Winners in each set of 20 competitors will be declared based on the best performing 
code according to the problem statement's scoring forumla. 
</li>

<li>
<b>Group B</b> - <i>Teams</i> - Individuals in this group will be split into sets of 4 Rooms of 5 individuals, with Rooms 
competing against the other designated Rooms to win the $1000 prize.  Room members will allowed to share code and ideas during 
the entire length of the competition. Winners will be chosen based on the best score for each room.  The Room score is equal to the 
highest individual score in the Room.  Prizes will be allocated among the Contestants in the winning Room according to their 
contribution, as judged by the others in their Room.    
</li>

</ul>
<br>
Participants in all groups may submit code written in any of the following languages: Java, C++, C#.NET, VB.NET, or Python.
All sets of 20 will be isolated from one another so that there are no spillovers of information, discussions, or code amongst the groups. 
In addition, each team will be placed into a private competition with their own forum and standings information.  Competitors will need
to use the web-based interface for participating in the competition - no experimental rounds will be accessible from within the TopCoder Arena.
<br><br>
Keep in mind that there is no actual problem statement associated with the "registration" round.  
<br><br>
<b>After the registration period closes on October 28th, 2009, we may ask you some brief questions to help us us determine the groupings of 20. 
The email with the link to the brief questions will come from TopCoder and we request that you respond to it within 12 hours.</b>
<br><br>
<b>We ask that 
you register only if you plan to dedicate significant effort and time to this competition</b> that begins on November 4, 2009 and 
will last for ten days, and you are willing to complete the contribution list (if applicable) and the Post-Competition Survey following the 
competition. In addition, the number of available spaces for competitors is limited and we will only allow 480 competitors into 
the competition with preference given to competitors who have demonstrated a high likelihood of participating in contests after 
they register.  Once registration is closed, and prior to the start of the competition, you will receive an email with your Group 
and Room assignment. 
<br><br>
Harvard's Professor Lakhani has been active in the forums discussing this Experimental Marathon Series. His handle is

		In addition, one $1,000 cash prize will be awarded to either the individual in Group A or the Room in Group B with the highest score.  
		If this prize is awarded to a Room in Group B it will be divided according to the contribution lists for that Room. 
		<br><br>
		Contestants must be active participants in order to be eligible to receive any prize.  In both Groups A and B, active 
		participation means working on the problem and submitting a reasonable attempt at a solution, including all required 
		parts (e.g., solution description, contribution list in Group B), responding to any email inquiries, and completing all 
		competition-related surveys, including the Post-Competition Survey.  In Group B, active participation includes providing 
		a contribution list as requested (including the final contribution list) whether or not a Contestants has submitted code 
		during the competition, and may include, instead of code submission, productive participation in the Room forums.
