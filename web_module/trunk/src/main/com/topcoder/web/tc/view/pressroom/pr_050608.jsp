<span class="bodySubtitle">About the Betfair Developers Program</span><br />
The Betfair Developers Program is a program dedicated to assisting Betfair users to integrate their business or personal needs with the Betfair exchange platforms. A member of the Betfair Developers Program can use the Betfair API's to create custom applications for personal, commercial or third party use.
</p>

<p>
<span class="bodySubtitle">About Betfair APIs</span><br />
The <strong>Games</strong> API allows developers to write their own applications that seamlessly integrate with the Betfair Games system. This offers the potential to build a wide range of applications from a new client front end to the system as an alternative to the existing website, to an automated betting tool. The implementation of the web service uses a framework known as Representational State Transfer (REST). This enables developers to interact with the Betfair Games system using simpler development and runtime technologies like HTTP and XML.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>Sports</strong> API enables developers to create applications that provide a customized interface, functionality and specialized operations not otherwise afforded by the web interface.
