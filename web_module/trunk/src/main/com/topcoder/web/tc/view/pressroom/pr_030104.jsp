</div>

<p><strong>GLASTONBURY, Conn., March 1, 2004&#151;</strong>

TopCoder, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, skills assessment and competitive software development, today announced that Jason Winokur of Columbia University has won the DoubleClick 2004 Coding Challenge.  In the DoubleClick employee competition, first place finisher was Eliot Horowitz of the New York City office.  The competition was open to all eligible students at Columbia University and New York University as well as DoubleClick employees. The tournament was designed to highlight the competitors' relative skills in the analysis of complex algorithmic problems and the ability to write software to solve those problems.</p>

<p>Winokur overcame nine other students representing Columbia and NYU in the final round at DoubleClick's Headquarters in New York City on Friday to claim the top honors and take home the first place purse of $5,000. The remainder of the student finalists shared an additional $5,000 in prize money.  In the parallel competition for employees, DoubleClick's own software engineers battled in the TopCoder arena applet to evaluate their professional skill sets. DoubleClick Software Engineer Horowitz earned a 32 inch Sony Plasma TV for his victorious effort.  Of the remaining finalists, the top three received Garmin iQue 3600 Palm devices with integrated GPS, and the rest were awarded their choice of a Canon PowerShot S400 digital camera or an Apple iPod.</p>

<p>"TopCoder's competition model provides us with a powerful tool for recruitment and assessment as we look to identify the next generation of DoubleClick's programming talent," said Mok Choe, Chief Information Officer, DoubleClick.  "We've also generated a lot of excitement within our internal development group and given our own talent a chance to shine."</p>

<p>DoubleClick used the TopCoder challenge to cultivate the competitive spirit and the technical strength of the contestants who solved the same set of complex problems during two rounds of competitions using Java, C++, C# or Visual Basic as their language of choice.</p>

<p>"Many of the world's top technology companies use TopCoder to reach both professional and collegiate developers," said Rob Hughes, President of TopCoder.  "Nothing attracts an audience like competition, and TopCoder sets the pace."</p>
