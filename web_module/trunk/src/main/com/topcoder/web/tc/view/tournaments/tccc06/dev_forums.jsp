Three reasons to join us at the 2006 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge:
<br><br>

<span class="bodySubtitle">Wednesday, November 15</span>
<br><br>
<b>3:00PM - 4:00PM<br>
Applying the TopCoder Philosophy to New Frontiers</b><br>
Two TopCoder clients have utilized the core TopCoder philosophies of
competition-based business models and objective rating systems as means
of assessing performance and reducing risk.  In the first part of the
forum, there will be a discussion of how Aizling's competition model
works in the nursing field as well as the feedback system and shift
matching logic.  Continuing, the next topic will be Equitrader's
simulated trading competitions, how the rating system was tweaked, and
the new Equitrader Scripting language which enables members to create
autonomous trading bots.  The discussion will compare and contrast each
project with the TopCoder methodologies and the results of these
projects to date, with a focus on the benefits of these unique models
versus traditional business techniques.  There may also be a light
amount of discussion on how the TopCoder Software process was utilized
to implement each of these projects.

Estimating Project Size</b><br>
Use Case Points is a methodology to estimate the amount of effort
required to implement a project.  It is based on an evaluation of the
Use Cases and Actors from a Use Case model, the Technical Complexity
Factors of a project (such as language complexity and target
infrastructure), Environmental Complexity Factors (such as the
experience of the participating members), and Productivity Factor (PF)
obtained from historical project data (such as historical LOC/hour
efficiency for TopCoder assemblers).
