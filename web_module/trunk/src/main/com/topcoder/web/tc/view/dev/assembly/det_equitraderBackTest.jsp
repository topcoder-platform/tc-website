<span class="bigTitle">Equitrader Phase-2 Back-Test Environment</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The primary goal of the Equitrader Phase-2 project is to add support for autonomous trading scripts. Once this feature is added, Equitrader members will have the ability to create these trading algorithms in a new scripting language created by Equitrader specifically for trading purposes. Users will also have the ability to instantly test their algorithm against a wealth of historical stock data contained in the Equitrader database to determine how well their script performs.
<br><br>
The changes in Phase-2 are broken down into several modules. The goal of this assembly competition is to implement the back-testing environment that will allow users to test their algorithms against historical stock data present in the Equitrader database. This will provide users with instant results on the performance of their algorithm, instead of requiring days of real-time testing to get any useful results.
<br><br>
All of the code is contained in components that have recently been created. The main tasks will involve configuring these components and making sure they function together as designed. The back-test environment is a stand-alone application and as such should be easier to test than applications that run in an application server, for example. All documentation related to Phase-2 will be made available to the competitors once registered.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
This assembly competition will consist of prototype conversion, component integration, and extensive unit testing to ensure correct operation.
