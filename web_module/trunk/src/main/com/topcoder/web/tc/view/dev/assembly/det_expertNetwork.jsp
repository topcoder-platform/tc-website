<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The Expert Network application is the first release of a community web site. It includes one piece for experts to register themselves and view/edit their profile and an admin tool to approve experts and search through registered experts and view their profiles. Both pieces will be web based applications.
<br><br>
The Expert Network will be implemented as a ASP.NET web application, involving a front end written in ASPX/C# that communicates with XML Web Service back-end. The assembly of the Expert Network will consist mostly of integrating generic components that exist in the component catalog and implementing several plug-ins and implementations of these components.
<br><br>

Registration Features: 
<ul>
<li>Register Expert</li>
<li>Login/Logout/Recover Password</li>
<li>View/Edit Profile</li>
</ul>
Administration Features:
<ul>
<li>Approve Expert</li>
<li>View/Edit Expert Profile</li>
<li>Search Experts</li>
</ul>

These applications are to be used by a TopCoder client. All application documentation will be available once registered.
<br><br>
