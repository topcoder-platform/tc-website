            <h2>Opening Night Reception</h2>

            <p>by Matt Murphy, <em>TopCoder Staff</em><br />
            Wednesday, December 3, 2003</p>

            <p>In a final round that saw 11 out of a possible 12 submissions, it was <strong>dgarthur</strong> who posted the highest 
            score and walked away $50,000 richer as the Champion.</p>

            <p>The contest started off with <strong>Yarin, </strong><strong>dgarthur</strong> and <strong>sjelkjd</strong> all opening the 250-point problem and 
            <strong>dmwright</strong> opting to go with the 450.  <strong>Yarin</strong> took the early lead with a quick submission of the 250-pointer 
            for 237.49 points.  He then moved on to the 450.  <strong>sjelkjd</strong> was in next with his submission to the 250, 
            getting 213.97 points.  <strong>dgarthur</strong> brought in the lowest score on the 250 with his submission for 
            202.96 points.  He and <strong>sjelkjd</strong> both moved on to the 450.  Even before <strong>dmwright</strong> could log his first 
            submission, <strong>Yarin</strong> sent in his second, adding 385.26 points from his 450.  <strong>dmwright</strong> finally sent in 
            his first submission for 303.43 points on the 450.  He moved on to the 950, leaving the 250 for last.  
            <strong>dgarthur</strong> made up some ground by receiving 381.34 points for his 450-point submission, and moved 
            to the 950.</p>

            <div align="center">
            <table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0" class="pointsTable">
                <tr>
                    <td  class="pointsName">dgarthur</td>
                    <td class="pointsScore">1447.71</td>
                </tr>
                               			
                <tr>
                    <td  class="pointsName">Yarin</td>
                    <td class="pointsScore">1382.79</td>
                </tr>
                               			
                <tr>
                    <td  class="pointsName">dmwright</td>
                    <td class="pointsScore">1245.14</td>
                </tr>
                               			
                <tr>
                    <td  class="pointsName">sjelkjd</td>
                    <td class="pointsScore">246.08</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            </div>	

            <p><strong>sjelkjd</strong> offered the only action of the Challenge Phase by unsuccessfully challenging all 3 950-point 
            submissions and <strong>Yarin's</strong> 450-point submission.  System tests proved that challenging any of the other 
            competitor's submissions was in vain, as all submissions passed.  The final scores looked quite similar 
            to those at the end of the Coding Phase:</p>

            <div align="center">
            <table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0" class="pointsTable">
                <tr>
                    <td  class="pointsName">dgarthur</td>
                    <td class="pointsScore">1447.71</td>
                </tr>
                               			
                <tr>
                    <td  class="pointsName">Yarin</td>
                    <td class="pointsScore">1382.79</td>
                </tr>
                               			
                <tr>
                    <td  class="pointsName">dmwright</td>
                    <td class="pointsScore">1245.14</td>
                </tr>
                               			
                <tr>
                    <td  class="pointsName">sjelkjd</td>
                    <td class="pointsScore">246.08</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            </div>	

            <p><strong>dgarthur</strong> was all smiles during the media hour, and rightfully so.  He performed perfectly through 
            two onsite rounds and beat six very worthy competitors in two days.  Congratulations to dgarthur and 
            the 15 other semi-finalists for a great weekend of coding!</p>
