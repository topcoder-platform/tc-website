<span class="bigTitle">Metric Reporting System</span>
<br><br> 
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The Metric Reporting System provides an online reporting tool that will allow users to analyze a dynamic set of data using both static and dynamic graphs. Users will be able to generate graphs based on this data and apply filtering options to the data to focus the reports on specific subsets of data. In addition, the system will allow users to drag-n-drop pre-generated graphs from a master list to create a customized home page.
<br><br>
The Metric Reporting System is composed of a series of components built through the TopCoder Component Production methodology. Additionally, a set of components has been developed to utilize the ILOG Charts SDK.
<br><br>
Specific tasks of this application include:
<ul>
<li>Create an online system to allow users to view static and dynamic graphs</li>
<li>Integrate a reporting system using ILOG Charts (<A href="http://www.ilog.com" target="_blank">www.ilog.com</A>)</li>
</ul>
All code for the application is contained within components. Teams will be responsible for configuration of the components, configuration of the application, conversion of prototype (to content templates) and evaluation/enhancement of components.
<br><br>
These applications are to be used by a TopCoder client. All application documentation (including an assembly guide) will be available once registered. 
<br><br>
<b>NOTE:</b> Please see eligibility requirements below. Competitors must sign a non-disclosure agreement before being admitted into this competition. 
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
This assembly competition will consist of prototype conversion, component integration, and extensive unit testing to ensure correct operation.
<br><br>
This competition involves assembling the Reporting System. The greatest part of the application is implemented by custom and generic components that have recently been completed. The HTML Pages have also been converted to JSP pages. The main tasks will involve configuring these components, integrating them with the JSP pages, applying the ILOG tags to generate graphs and comprehensive unit testing to ensure correct operation. Teams will be required to commit their in-progress work to TopCoder's Subversion repository at the midpoint of the competition.

<div class="sectionHeader">Checkpoints</div>
This assembly competition will contain three checkpoints. The checkpoint deliverables will be defined in a document presented to contestants after an NDA document has been signed. After each checkpoint, the TopCoder team will review to verify the checkpoints are met. Teams who complete these checkpoints will be eligible for a bonus.
<br><br>
* The team with the winning submission will receive a $1000 bonus for each checkpoint met during the competition ($3000 max)
<br><br>
* The team with the second place submission will receive a $500 bonus for each checkpoint met during the competition ($1500 max).
<br><br>
In order to qualify for the checkpoint bonus, the team must create a tag by 11:59PM EST the evening the checkpoint is due.
