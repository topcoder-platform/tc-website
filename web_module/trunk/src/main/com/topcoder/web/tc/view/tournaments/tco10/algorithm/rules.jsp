                            <p>The 2010 TopCoder Open Algorithm Competition ("Algorithm Competition") will take place between March 29 and October 14, 2010. The Algorithm Competition will consist of three (3) online qualification rounds, five (5) online elimination rounds, with up to twenty-four (24) of the highest scoring competitors winning a trip to the Tournament to compete in the onsite Semifinal Round and/or Championship Rounds of the Algorithm Competition.</p>
                            <p>The Algorithm Competition is part of the Tournament, and by participating in this Algorithm Competition, you agree to these rules. Notwithstanding the eligibility requirements in the Rules, residents of Iran are eligible to compete and advance to the onsite rounds of the Algorithm Competition. However, residents of Iran are not eligible to receive any prizes except for those awarded to competitors participating in the Onsite Semifinal and/or Championship Rounds of the Algorithm Competition.</p>

                            <h3 class="subTitle">Registration</h3><!-- sub title-->
                            <p>Registration is open for the Algorithm Competition until Sunday, May 23, 2010 at 09:00 UTC -4. In order to compete in Qualification Rounds 1 or 2, individuals must be registered for the tournament at least 24 hours prior to the Start of that Qualification Round. There is no limit to the number of Competitors who can participate in the Algorithm Competition; however each Competitor may only participate using one handle.</p>

                            <h3 class="subTitle">Algorithm Competition Round Structure</h3><!-- sub title-->
                            <p>Each Online and Onsite Round of the Algorithm Competition (including the Qualification Rounds) consists of three phases: Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. (Note: The format of these competition rounds is similar to the format of TopCoder Single Round Matches. The rules in place for Single Round Matches as of March 29, 2010 will also apply to the online and onsite rounds of the Algorithm Competition, with the exception of the Unused Code Rule during the onsite rounds.)</p>
                            <p>The Coding Phase is a timed phase in which all Competitors are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and three levels of potential points. Points are awarded for each problem upon submission of a solution that successfully compiles. Points are calculated on the total time elapsed from the time the Competitor opened the problem until the time the Competitor's successfully compiling submission was submitted. During the Online Rounds, the Coding Phase will last 75 minutes. During the Onsite Rounds, the Coding Phase will last 85 minutes.</p>
                            <p>The Challenge Phase is a timed phase wherein each Competitor has the opportunity to challenge the functionality of any other Competitors' submission. If successful, the challenge will result in (i) the challenged Competitor losing any points awarded for the challenged submission, and (ii) a 50-point bonus for the challenging Competitor. If unsuccessful, the challenging competitor's point total in that round of the Competition will be reduced by 25 points. During the Online Rounds, the Challenge Phase will last 15 minutes. During the Onsite Rounds, the Challenge Phase will last 10 minutes.</p>
                            <p>The System Testing Phase applies to all submissions that have not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds a flawed submission, the Competitor who submitted that submission will lose all of the points that were originally awarded for that submission. The System Testing Phase consists of applying a set of inputs to a submission. If the output from a Competitor's submission is not correct, the submission is considered flawed and loses all points awarded. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</p>

To determine a Competitor's score during the Online Rounds, the total point values from all three phases of the round are added for each Competitor. The Competitors are then ranked in order of score, with the highest scoring Competitors advancing to the next round. To be eligible to advance to the next round of the Algorithm Competition, the Competitor must finish each round of the Algorithm Competition with a point total greater than zero.</p>
                            <p>The structure of the Online Rounds is as follows:</p>
