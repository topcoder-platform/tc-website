<strong>SAN FRANCISCO (Adobe MAX Conference) November 17, 2008 &#151;</strong>Ribbit, Silicon Valley's first phone company, today announced it is partnering with competitive software development community TopCoder to offer the Killer App Challenge, a chance for developers to create the next killer application on the Ribbit open platform for integrating voice communications in applications, web sites, and communities. The competition begins immediately and will conclude in March 2009. Cash prizes totaling $100,000 will be awarded to the most compelling, creative, and useful application in each of five development categories, as well as a grand prize for the best overall entrant. Full challenge details can be found at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ribbit.com/killerappchallenge">www.ribbit.com/killerappchallenge</a>.
</p>

<p>
"The latest version of our telephony platform brings even more incredible features into Rich Internet application development. We want to give developers the power to add valuable voice features to their existing apps and spark innovation towards creating applications never seen before," said Chuck Freedman, Director of Developer Platform at Ribbit. "The Killer App Challenge is an unparalleled opportunity for creative professionals, developers and entrepreneurs to have their ideas launched on this global stage. We're looking for the kind of apps that will improve interactions between business and user, help brands better interact with their audiences, and evolve social networking into the next level of essential communication."
</p>

<p>
The Ribbit platform - a carrier-grade telephony-plus-software infrastructure with a community of 7,000-plus application developers - is enabling enterprises to completely rethink the way they manage their customer relationships via voice. By treating voice as a data object, Ribbit lets developers add feature-rich voice capabilities to any application, on any device - capabilities such as updating records by phone, integrating voice and messages into a single workflow, and initiating many automated processes via voice command.
</p>

<p>
The five challenge categories are:<br />
<ul>
    <li><strong>Media, Advertising and Entertainment</strong> - Add unprecedented interactive value to a media campaign by captivating a target audience through rich voice capabilities</li>
    <li><strong>Social Networking and Communication</strong> - Create a Web 3.0 preview application that connects people via Open Telephony</li>
    <li><strong>Business and Productivity</strong> - Integrate voice and rich communication features into a business application workflow</li>
    <li><strong>Carrier, Network, or ISP Integration</strong> - Integrate innovative voice capabilities into an existing cable, carrier, mobile network, or ISP</li>
    <li><strong>Wildcard</strong> - Create an application that uses voice to improve the usability of any device or interface, from vending machines to ticket kiosks</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Developers retain full ownership of their applications, so even those applications not chosen as a challenge winner can be deployed to deliver exciting new voice capabilities to customers, partners and employees.
