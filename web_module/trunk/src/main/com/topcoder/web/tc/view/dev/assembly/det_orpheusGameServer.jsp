<span class="bigTitle">Orpheus Game Server and Client Modules</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The Orpheus game is an on-line scavenger hunt, in which players search the Internet for clues, keys, and an elusive 'ball' containing real cash prizes.  Players use their usual web browser to participate (Internet Explorer and Firefox initially supported), enabling it as a game client by installing a browser extension.  The game does not require participating web sites to be modified in any way; instead, information about the location and identity of target objects is maintained internally by the game's own server, and provided to clients on an as-needed basis.
<br><br>
Game players will be able to log in to the system, participate in one or more game instances, receive notifications and clues to lead them to the scavenger hunt targets, and ultimately to 'unlock the ball' to obtain the money inside.  The game also provides information about past and future participating sites and about players' relative standing in specific games.
<br><br>
The game server will be implemented as a J2EE web application, involving servlets and JSPs backed by an EJB-based interface to persistent storage. The clients will be implemented as browser extensions using the target browsers' extension mechanisms - XUL / XPI for Firefox and COM for Internet Explorer.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
This competition involves assembling the game server and the associated client plug-ins / extensions.  The greatest part of the application is implemented by custom and generic components that have recently been completed.  The main tasks will involve configuring these components, writing application deployment descriptors, writing UI code and packaging for the extensions, converting the existing HTML prototype to JSP, and comprehensive unit testing to ensure correct operation.
