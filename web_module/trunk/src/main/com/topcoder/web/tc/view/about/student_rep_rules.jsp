		<br><br>

		<strong>NO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN.  VOID WHERE PROHIBITED.</strong>
		<br><br>

		<strong>OVERVIEW</strong><br/>
		TopCoder, Inc. will be conducting a challenge for student representatives during the 2006 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge (TCCC06).  As a result of this challenge, one student representative will be awarded with a trip to attend the onsite finals of the TCCC06 in November 2006.
		<br><br>

		<strong>ELIGIBILITY</strong><br/>
		To be eligible for the challenge, you must be:
		<ul>
			<li>18 years of age or older; and </li>
			<li>A registered member of TopCoder in good standing.</li>
		</ul>

		Employees of TopCoder, Inc., their affiliated companies, advertising and promotion agencies and immediate family members of each are not eligible. Employees of any TCCC06 sponsoring companies are allowed to compete in the 2006 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge Student Representative Challenge.  All federal, state and local laws and regulations apply. Void where prohibited.
		<br><br>
		<strong>TO ENTER</strong><br/>
		If not already a member, register for TopCoder electronically at <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/" target="_blank">www.topcoder.com</a>.  Once registered at TopCoder, send an email to
		Jessie D'Amato Ford (<a href="mailto:jdamato@topcoder.com?subject=TopCoder Student Reps">jdamato@topcoder.com</a>) stating the following:

		<ol>
			<li>Include the name of the college/university you will be distributing flyers to.</li>
			<li>Include your TopCoder handle.</li>
			<li>Include your mailing address.  This will be the address where the flyers are sent.</li>
		</ol>

		There is no limit of student representatives at a college/university.
		<br><br>
		<strong>SELECTION OF WINNER</strong></br>
		The winner will be the student representative who has converted the greatest number of new TopCoder registrants attributed to their handle into participants of the 2006 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge. In the case of a tie, the winner will be decided by the highest total new TopCoder registrants that are attributed to the tied student representatives' handles. If a tie still remains, then all tied student representatives will receive the prize. New registrants will be tracked from 9:00 AM EDT on July 17, 2006 through 9:00 AM EDT on September 14, 2006. In order for new registrants to be counted toward a student representative's total, each new registrant must state the student representative's TopCoder handle as the reason for registering at TopCoder. New registrants stating only your college/university will not count towards your total. No adjustments will be made for new registrants who do not state the student representative's handle upon registration.
		<br><br>
		<strong>PRIZE</strong><br/>
		One (1) student representative will be awarded a trip to attend the onsite finals of the 2006 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge.  TopCoder will provide travel arrangements for the winning student representative, up to a cost of $1,500. (That is, if the airfare is greater than $1,500, the student representative will be responsible for the difference between the cost of the airfare and $1,500.) TopCoder will provide ground transportation to and from the airport, as well as hotel accommodations and meals for the student representative. All other expenses are the responsibility of the student representative. TopCoder will not provide travel or lodging accommodations for a guest to accompany the student representative to the 2006 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge.  The winner accepts responsibility for all federal, state, and local taxes and fees in connection with the prize.
