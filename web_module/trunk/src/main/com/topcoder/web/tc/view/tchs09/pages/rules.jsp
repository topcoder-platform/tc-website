								<h2>Scoring and Advancing during Online Rounds</h2>
									<p>After each Online Round, the highest scorers from across all rooms will be identified and will advance to the next online round. Coder advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round for each coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater-than-zero) point total. The structure of each Online Round is as follows:</p>
								<h2>Online Round 1</h2>
									<p>All registered competitors will compete and up to 500 will advance. </p>
									<p>The highest 500 scoring competitors across all rooms will advance to Online Round 2.</p>
							  <h2>Online Round 2</h2>
									<p>Up to 500 competitors will compete and up to 250 will advance. </p>
									<p>The highest 250 scoring competitors across all rooms will advance to Online Round 3.</p>
							  <h2>Online Round 3</h2>
									<p>Up to 250 competitors will compete and up to 100 will advance. </p>
									<p>The highest 100 scoring competitors across all rooms will advance to the Online Championship round.</p>
							  <p><strong>In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the Online Rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:</strong></p>
										<ul class="rules">
                                            <li class="rules">Total points acquired (higher is better) during the previous round of competition.</li>
                                            <li class="rules">If a tie still remains, then by best rating at the start of the Tournament.</li>
                                            <li class="rules">If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round.</li>
                                        </ul>
									
								<h2>Competition Round Structure</h2>
									<p>Each round of competition consists of three phases: Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. (Note: The format of these competition rounds is similar to the format of TopCoder High School Single Round Matches. The rules in place for TCHS Single Round Matches as of December 15, 2008 will also apply to the rounds of TCHS09 and are hereby incorporated into these rules.)</p>
									<p>The Coding Phase is a timed event where all competitors are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened until the time it was submitted.</p>
									<p>The Challenge Phase is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger. Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.</p>
									<p>The System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</p>

								<h2>Championship Round</h2>
									<p>All competitors will be randomly assigned to virtual competition rooms. Rooms will be created such that each room has a maximum of 25 competitors. The number of rooms in each round is (the # of competitors who advanced to the round)/25.</p>
									<p>The Championship Round will be a single round of one hundred (100) coders. The winning individual in the Championship Round will be the competitor with the highest score in the round.</p>
                                    <p><strong>In the event of a tie in the Championship Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order):</strong></p>
									<ul class="rules">
                                        <li class="rules">Total points acquired (higher is better) during Online Rounds #1, #2 and #3 of the 2009 TCHS Tournament.<br />
                                          <br />
                                        </li>
                                      <li class="rules">If a tie still remains in the Championship Round, then the prize will be distributed equally among the tied competitors.</li>
									</ul>
								<h2>About the Prizes</h2>
									<p>The Tournament will award participatory prizes to up to 500 competitors and $10,000 in scholarships and prizes to up to 50 competitors. Any and all applicable taxes on prizes are the sole responsibility of the prizewinner. Prizes will be distributed as follows:</p>
