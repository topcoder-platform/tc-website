<span class="bigTitle">Online Review Scorecard Admin</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The Online Review and Scorecard Project will make modifications to TopCoder's current online review and scorecard systems to reduce the amount of time spent performing reviews.
<br><br>
The entire infrastructure of Online Review and Scorecards will be redesigned to be more flexible and provide better insight into TopCoder's application process.    The current Online Review system automates the TopCoder Software peer review process only for Component Designs and Component Developments. The new infrastructure will allow more project types (i.e. Application Specification, Application Architecture), multiple scorecards per project (i.e. FDA, SOX, SEC), optional review phases (i.e. submission) and custom review phases (i.e. client review). The creation of "on demand" review will allow projects to advance to the next phase as soon as the review is complete rather than wait for a deadline to pass or manually advancing the project to the next phase.  
<br><br>
TopCoder wishes to enable the front page of online review to provide proper breakouts of each project phase and also the ability for users to view only projects for which they are associated. This will allow PMs, clients and architects to view project status and timelines for all project types.  
<br><br>
The Online Review Application automates the TopCoder Software peer review process for both Component Design and Component Development projects.   Reviewers are able to login, check the status of their assignments, download submissions for review, complete online review forms and perform aggregation of reviews.  The administration section allows users to set up reviews, assign members, monitor the process and intervene at any stage of development.
<br><br>
TopCoder will modify their current Scorecard Admin tool to enhance the Online Review process. Administrators will have the ability to set multiple default scorecards per project phase and create client specific scorecards. Scorecards will be created for various project types including: Applications, Assembly Competitions, Testing Competitions as well as Components.  
<br><br>
Although the application will be initially used by TopCoder, the intention is to build the application in a generic fashion such that it could be used by any organization.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
This assembly competition will consist of creating, editing and viewing scorecards.
