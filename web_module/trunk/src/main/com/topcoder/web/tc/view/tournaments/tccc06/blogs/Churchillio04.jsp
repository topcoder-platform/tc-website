The morning started for all round 1 semi-finalists at 8:30, when they were given a half hour each to prepare their macros and set up the editors they would be using to code. There was a fairly wide spread of editors used by the competitors -- just some examples were <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" context="algorithm"/> using gvim, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="260835" context="algorithm"/> using xemacs, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="9927526" context="algorithm"/> using notepad++, and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="22641658" context="algorithm"/> using jedit. After the setup, all the first rounders were gathered in a line for the big picture and introduction in front of the big screen. As “the movie voice guy” called out all of their names and hometowns, they each walked back to their seating positions. 
<br /><br />
At the start many were gathered around the top seeder coders such as <tc-webtag:handle coderId="19849563" context="algorithm"/>, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" context="algorithm"/>, and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10157606" context="algorithm"/>. Many people first crowded around <tc-webtag:handle coderId="19849563" context="algorithm"/>'s machine as he was testing problem 1 very quickly. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="19849563" context="algorithm"/> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" context="algorithm"/> both submitted the 250 point problem within about a minute, for 243 and 238 points respectively. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="19849563" context="algorithm"/> then went for the 1000-point problem while <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" context="algorithm"/> went for the 600. Most of the competitors who solved the first problem went for the 600, with just <tc-webtag:handle coderId="19849563" context="algorithm"/>, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="260835" context="algorithm"/>, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="22641345" context="algorithm"/> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10157606" context="algorithm"/> going for the 1000 point problem second. 
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="19849563" context="algorithm"/> had the first 1000 point submission for 693 points at 9:22, but he then continued to run custom test cases for about 15 minutes before moving on to the next problem. People were wondering whether he was having second thoughts about his submission, due to the test cases he was running. He put multiple checks in his code and tried to break it until he decided it was good. He then went back to the first problem and looked at that for a minute before opening the 600 point problem. A group of about 8 people had gathered around the big screen in the back where they were reading problems 2 and 3, trying to figure them out on paper as the contestants were coding. 
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="260835" context="algorithm"/> was the next to submit a second problem. He submitted the 1000 point problem and immediately opened the 600 point question at 9:39. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10157606" context="algorithm"/> was the third submitter of the 1000 point problem for 583 points at 9:49. Most of the competitors now had problem 2 open including <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" context="algorithm"/>, who was still working at test cases. Many of the spectators crowded around the monitors thought there was a fairly simple binary search solution to the second problem, but realized that since nobody else had gotten it there must be something they were missing.  <tc-webtag:handle coderId="286375" context="algorithm"/> was the first person to submit problem 2 after passing the given test cases at 9:50 for 550 points. Quickly after this, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="15094447" context="algorithm"/> submits problem 2 at the same time <tc-webtag:handle coderId="9927526" context="algorithm"/> submits problem 3.
<br /><br />
At around 9:58 AM some laughter came from <tc-webtag:handle coderId="19849563" context="algorithm"/>'s screen as his test cases were returning -1 instead of 10^7, and 10^24 instead of -1. The test cases for most people for problem 2 just didn't seem to be agreeing with them. As this was going on there was a surprising submission by <tc-webtag:handle coderId="22641658" context="algorithm"/>, who took the current lead by submitting problem 3. Around the same time, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" context="algorithm"/> had abandoned problem 2 to take a stab at problem 3. People were now gathered around <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" context="algorithm"/>'s screen in order to see if he was implementing the same solution others had done for their problem 3 submissions, which he seemed to be doing. 
<br /><br />
The leader board remained unchanged until around 10:22, with 4 minutes left <tc-webtag:handle coderId="15094447" context="algorithm"/> submitted problem 2 -- the first coder with all 3 completed. He seemed confident at this submission, since he then maximized the leader board on his screen and leaned back in his chair. With 45 seconds left, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="260835" context="algorithm"/> submitted problem 2 for all 3 problems submitted and the current lead. Frantically typing, the only other coder to have a last minute submission was <tc-webtag:handle coderId="286375" context="algorithm"/>, who submitted problem 3 with only 3 seconds left on the timer. 
<br /><br />
There was now a 5 minute break before the challenge phase, during which everyone crowded around the two main screens at the front of the room to await the challenges. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10157606" context="algorithm"/> had two quick first challenges, one correct and one incorrect. Cheers went up as <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10157606" context="algorithm"/> then got another correct challenge. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8398526" context="algorithm"/> then had two quick correct challenges, as well as <tc-webtag:handle coderId="22641345" context="algorithm"/> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="307060" context="algorithm"/> who each had a correct challenge. Then the place went nuts as <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10157606" context="algorithm"/> had two more correct challenges, and then a final challenge vs. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="260835" context="algorithm"/>'s second problem to bring <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10157606" context="algorithm"/> from 6th place up to first. With the challenge phase now over and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10157606" context="algorithm"/> doing an amazing job on the challenges, everyone gathered around once again to awaiting the system tests.
<br /><br />
As the TopCoder staff walked in with the results in hand, they showed the system tests one at a time from the last place contestant up to the first. A few contestants failed the first problem, but not a whole lot changed in terms of standings. With the last 6 contestants each solving problem 1 and problem 3, the system test meter steadily went through its paces. Each of the contestants got green checks in front of problem 1 and problem 3, and the crowd dutifully applauded. Then, I heard truly shocked gasps as I looked up and saw a red X in front of <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" context="algorithm"/>'s problem 3. People stopped clapping for a moment as <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" context="algorithm"/> slid to 7th place, just one spot outside of the wildcard round. The first place seed would be completely knocked out of the tournament unless <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10157606" context="algorithm"/> or <tc-webtag:handle coderId="19849563" context="algorithm"/> failed their system tests... but they didn't. They clinched the top 2 spots and a spot in the finals. It was a huge upset in the first round and just goes to show that absolutely nobody is safe until the system tests are completed.
