                <h3>Design / Development Ratings</h3>
                
                <p>
                After each competition, each coder who submitted a solution to the competition is re-rated according to the following algorithm. Keep in mind that software competitions consist of the last 500 scored components of the same level.  The ranking of each coder is then determined based on the score the coder received compared to the scores of the components of the same level.  The rating used for the previous scores is the rating of the coder at the time the coder submitted the solution.
                The average rating of everyone is then calculated:
                <BR/>
                                    <BR/>

                                    <BR/>
                Where NumCoders is the number of coders in the competition and Rating is the 
                rating without the volatility of the coder in the competition before the competition.

                                    <BR/>

                The probability of the coder getting a higher score than another coder in the 
                competition (WPi for i from 1 to NumCoders) is estimated.  See below for the 'Estimation Algorithm'.
                The expected rank of the coder is calculated:

Taking the difference of each coder's performance is also a normal 
distribution.  A positive value would then indicate a win and a negative 
value would indicate a loss.  The percentage chance that a player wins, 
therefore, uses the standard normal cumulative disribution as follows:
    <BR />
 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;        WinProbability( SkillA, DeviationA, SkillB, DeviationB)
    <BR/>
 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;        Return snorm( (SkillB-SkillA) / Math.sqrt(DeviationA^2 + DeviationB^2) )

<BR/>Using this model, a coder's
performance can be turned into a percentage using the normal distribution, so that 50% represents expected
performance and 25% represents better three days out of four, etc.  Then, to estimate the probability that the
coder beats coder i, the range from 0% to 100% is broken into 1% blocks, and the midpoint is taken of each
block and the corresponding performance is computed.  The win probability is the number of blocks where the
midpoint favors coder i.  If it's a tie, the block is split between both coders.   
                <BR/>
                                    <BR/>
Here is the psuedo-code function to estimate the probability of coder A beating coder B
(<IMG ALT="inverse standard normal" HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" SRC="/i/rating/phi.gif" BORDER="0"/> is the inverse of the
standard normal function):

            <h3>Reliability Rating</h3>
<p>Member profiles have been modified to reflect a reliability factor for all component design and development competitions. 
The reliability factor is calculated as the percent of projects that a member registers for in which that same 
member presents a timely submission that achieves the minimum passing component score of 70.</p>

<p>Members will be eligible to receive a bonus on top of any prize money won if their Reliability Ratings are equal to or exceed 
80%. Winning members with Reliability Ratings equal to or exceeding 80% and less than 90% will receive a bonus equal to 10% 
of the prize. For Reliability Ratings equal to or exceeding 90% and less than 95%, winning members will receive a bonus equal 
to 15% of the prize. And winning members with a Reliability Rating equal to or exceeding of 95% will receive a bonus equal 
to 20% of the prize. The following is an example of payouts based on the member's Reliability Rating:</p>
