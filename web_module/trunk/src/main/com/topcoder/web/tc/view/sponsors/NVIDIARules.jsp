        <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Overview</span><br />
       The NVIDIA CUDA Superhero Challenge("Competition") will take place between September 14, 2009 and December 7, 2009. The Competition will award a total prize purse of $5,000. TopCoder members must register for the Competition.  Registration may occur at any time between the opening of registration to the deadline for submissions. All competitors who have registered for the Competition will be given access to the competition problem statement</p>
        
        <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Eligibility</span><br />
        The Competition is open to all members of the TopCoder website, who have agreed to the terms thereof, and who are at least 18 years of age as of the start date of the Competition. Competitors must be (i) a U.S. citizen, (ii) a lawful permanent resident of the U.S., (iii) a temporary resident, asylee, refugee of the U.S., or have a lawfully issued work authorization card permitting unrestricted employment in the U.S., (iv) a non-U.S. resident authorized in the country in which the member resides while participating in the Competition to perform services as an independent contractor; or (v) be in the United States under a valid and current visa issued by the United States government which does not prohibit receiving a cash prize.</p>
        <p>A Competitor is not eligible for the Competition if he/she is a resident of the Quebec province of Canada.  Prizes will not be paid to residents of Iran, Cuba, North Korea, Sudan or Syria. In addition, a Competitor is not eligible for the Competition if the Competitor is on the Specially Designated National list promulgated and amended, from time to time, by the United States Department of the Treasury.</p>
        <p>All Competitors must be registered members of TopCoder, and must have agreed to these Rules prior to and as a condition for registering and participating in the Competition.</p>
        <p>Competitors must abide by the Terms of Use of TopCoder's website at <a href="http://www.topcoder.com">www.topcoder.com</a>. Violation of the Terms of Use may result in disqualification from the Competition, and/or further consequences as determined in TopCoder's sole discretion.</p>
        <p>Current employees of TopCoder and NVIDIA and those involved in the development, production (including prize suppliers and sponsors), implementation and distribution of the Competition and their advertising or promotion agencies, parent companies, service providers, agents, officers, subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other persons or entities directly associated with the Competition and members of their immediate families and/or persons living in the same household as such persons, are ineligible to enter the Competition.</p>

        <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Match Structure</span><br />
        The format of the Competition is similar to a TopCoder Marathon Match. The rules in place for such competitions as of September 1, 2009, as may be amended by the rules for this Competition, will apply to this Competition.</p>
        <p>The Competition shall consist of two phases: the Coding Phase and the System Testing Phase.</p>
        <p><em>Coding Phase</em><br />
        The Coding Phase is a timed event where all competitors are presented with the same problem statement. The criteria for scoring will be provided in the problem statement and may change in each Round. During each Round, each competitor may submit one of two types of submissions: an Example Submission or a Full Submission.</p>
		<p>Each Example Submission is run against the example test cases listed in the problem statement and detailed feedback is provided to the competitor. Each Full Submission is run against a more complete set of test cases which are unknown to the competitor and the competitor receives a provisional score only. The duration of the Coding Phase is two weeks.</p>
		
        <p><em>System Testing Phase</em><br />
        The System Testing Phase is applied to the most recent Full Submission for each competitor. During system testing, each Full Submission is run against a large number of sample cases not disclosed previously to the competitors, and is scored according to the criteria specified in the problem statement. Once the system tests are completed, competitors are ranked according to their score on the system test cases. The score a competitor's Full Submission receives is determined solely by the system testing.</p>
		<p>The winning competitor will be the competitor that scores the most points across all competitors.</p>

        <p>In the event of a tied score, the tied competitors will split the award for each place. For example, if 1st and 2nd place are tied, they would both share the prizes for 1st and 2nd place. In other words, each would receive $1,750.00 (($2,500.00+$1,000.00)/2).</p>
