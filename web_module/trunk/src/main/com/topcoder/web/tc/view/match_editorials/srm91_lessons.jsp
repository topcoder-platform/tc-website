<span class="bodySubtitle">SRM 91</span><br>May 22, 2002
<br /><br />

<span class="bigTitle">Lessons Learned the Hard Way</span>

<P>
SRM 91 was a wednesday night contest.  As a landmark, it was the 
first challenge sponsored by Citrix.  In all, 654 coders took part.
There were 43 rooms in Division-II, of which 4 rooms were in the 
rookie section.
</P>

<P>
The first two problems appear to have been quite easy: both had
solution rates above 70%.  In contrast, the level 3 problem caused a
lot of problems: the solution rate was 31.9%, and approximately 14% of
the coders solved it successfully.
</P>

<P>
<B>250 (Perfect):</B>
</P>

<P>
Take an integer, sum its divisors (not including the number, and check
whether the result is equal to, less than, or greater than the initial
number.
</P>

<P>
The solution is quite simple.  Code based on the following should be
quite sufficient:
</P>

<P>
<pre>
sum = 1;
for (i=2; i&#60;sqrt(n+1); i++) {
    if (n % i == 0) {
   sum+= i;
   if (i &#60; n/i) {
       sum+= n/i;
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</P>

<P>
Problems:
<OL>
   <LI>Only checking up to sqrt(n), without adding the second of a pair of 
   divisors.</LI>    
   <LI>Using (sum &#60; n) as a loop guard.</LI>
   <LI>Including sqrt of n twice when counting factors.</LI>
</OL>
</P>


<P>
<B>500 (ChallengePhase):</B>
</P>

<P>
In challenge phase of an SRM, a problem is submitted which uses a
random number generator.  The result is that it is likely to be
correct 50% of the time.  Given the scores within the room, the prize
for the first three places, and the assumption that all submissions
are correct, return the difference between the gain from a successful
challenge (ie ev(success) - ev(current) and the loss from an unsuccessful
challenge.
</P>

<P>
Problems:
<OL>
   <LI>Assuming that the scores table was sorted.  (All the examples were
   sorted)</LI>    
   <LI>In a solution which created three ArrayLists to contain the scores
in each case, adding the "success" score, to the "fail" List.</LI>
   <LI>Divide by zero exception.</LI>
   <LI>Errors in indexing into the array.  This cropped up in a solution
which counted how many results were less than a particular score. Had the coder counted the number greater, it is likely the error 
would not have occurred.</LI>
</OL>
</P>


<P>
<B>1000 (Rumba):</B>
</P>

<P>
The task is to simulate a Rumba dance, and check that each of 5 steps
are included.  There are 3 different positions allowed, and some steps
are not allowed to begin from some positions.  Each step ends in a
particular position.  The return is an int array, the first element of
which is the number of steps not included in the dance steps list.
The second element is either -1 if the dance is legal, or else the
index of the first step which cannot be danced.
</P>

<P>
The problem is might effectively tackled as a State Transition Machine.
Internal to the program, the coder needs to write a function which
takes the current state and next step, and returns the new state or
invalid.  The submission would then loop over the steps input.
</P>

<P>
As an additional complication, the "BASIC" step could have more than one
output, and the BACKWARD WALK step output depended on its input to determine
its output.
</P>

<P>
Problems:
<OL>
   <LI>Trying to use if-then-else to handle the logic.  Since some steps
           output state depended on their input state, this could not work.</LI>    
   <LI>Mis-understanding the problem description.  This was definitely a 
   problem worth reading more than once.  Some people simply coded the
   wrong rules.</LI>
   <LI>Not realising that input state was inportant for some steps.</LI>
</OL>
</P>


<P>
As in most simulation problems, it's hard to point to a general problem.
The difficulty is in translating the problem into code, and that's where
the errors crop up.
