<b>Qualification Round &mdash; 9 PM EDT Tuesday, September 12</b><br>
The format for each Qualification Round will be the same as all other tournament rounds, which is outlined in the <A href="#roundstructure">Competition Round Structure</A> section.
<br><br>
<b>NOTE:</b>  In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the Qualification Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:
<ul>
<li>By rating (higher is better) prior to the Qualification Round.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<a name="structure"></a>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Online Elimination Rounds</span>
<br><br>
Everyone who competes in an online round must login to the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than five (5) minutes prior to the start of the online round. Sponsor employees and interns from around the world may be participating in the online rounds, but all start times will be communicated as Eastern Daylight Time (GMT -4), so contestants in different time zones must adjust accordingly. If a coder does not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition. 
<br><br>
All Sponsor Track competitors who have qualified for an online round will be assigned to one specific room for each round of the competition.
<br><br>
The dates and times of the online rounds of competition are as follows:

<span class="bodySubtitle">Scoring and Advancing during Online Rounds</span>
<br><br>

After each round of competition, the highest scorers from across the room will be identified and will advance to the next online round.  Coder advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round for each coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater-than-zero) point total. The structure of the online rounds is as follows:
<br><br>

<b>Online Round #1</b><br>
Up to 100 coders will compete in Round #1 and up to 50 will advance.  The highest 50 scorers from the room will advance to Online Round #2.
<br><br>

<b>Online Round #2</b><br>
Up to 50 coders will compete and up to 25 will advance.  The highest 25 scorers from the room will advance to the Final Online Round.
<br><br>

<b>Final Online Round</b><br>
This round will be the last round of the Sponsor Track Competition.  Up to 25 coders will compete and the coder who finishes with the highest score will be the winner of the Sponsor Track Competition.
<br><br>

<b>NOTE:</b>  In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the online rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:
<ul>
<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during the previous online rounds of the tournament.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then by rating (higher is better) following the Qualification Round.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<a name="roundstructure"></a>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Round Structure</span>
<br><br>

Each online round of competition consists of three phases: the Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. (Note: The format of these competition rounds is similar to the format of TopCoder Single Round Matches.  The rules in place for the Single Round Matches as of September 12, 2006 will also apply to the online rounds of the Sponsor Track Competition.)
<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>The Coding Phase</b> is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened until the time it was submitted.  The Coding Phase will last 75 minutes.</li>
<li><b>The Challenge Phase</b> is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.  The Challenge Phase will last 15 minutes.</li>
<li><b>The System Testing Phase</b> is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem.  No test cases from the Challenge Phase of the Sponsor Track Competition will be added to the test cases used for the System Testing Phase of the Sponsor Track Competition.</li>
</ul>
