(OK, I know I won't be able to pull the Star Wars thing off, so I'm going to quit while I'm ahead.)
<br/><br/>
Tuesday night was the welcome reception, and boy did I meet a lot of people.  At first it was really weird, still, that I was finally
meeting some folks after "knowing" them in the arena.  Ironically, as I mentioned to <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8416646" darkBG="true" />,
coders tend not to be the most social bunch, myself included.  I find it hard to meet new people and especially to make
new friends.  But I was determined to "stick it out" and try to meet at least some of the people I had planned on
meeting.
<br/><br/>
On my "todo" list of people to meet included people who I've been in touch with:
<ul>
<li><tc-webtag:handle coderId="119676" darkBG="true" /> - after all, who <i>wouldn't</i> want to meet him!</li>
<li><tc-webtag:handle coderId="7545675" darkBG="true" /> - despite different languages, we had some things in common, TopCoder being one of them.</li>
<li><tc-webtag:handle coderId="260835" darkBG="true" /> - to chat about NY and MIT</li>
</ul>
Funny how things work out, though, because I did wind up meeting all the above people, and more.  I recognized<tc-webtag:handle coderId="275071" darkBG="true" />
 right away. I had already been talking with <tc-webtag:handle coderId="260835" darkBG="true" />,who just graduated from MIT last year; we were talking about the Stata center and the old Building 20 (which he hadn't seen).
Reid is at Harvard now -- my son Aaron would be impressed, since he aspires to go to Harvard too, which is funny considering... <tc-webtag:handle coderId="269554" darkBG="true" /> was there too -- great sense of humor!
<br/><br/>
For a while I was hanging out with just <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8416646" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="282718" darkBG="true" /> when they started
the introductory speeches.  Rob Hughes thanked each sponsor (and in fact right now I'm typing on an AMD laptop, generously
loaned to us bloggers by AMD), and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7267401" darkBG="true" /> went over some of the rules for the algorithms competitions
tomorrow.  The one line that solicited a response was that the <a href="/tc?module=Static&d1=help&d2=ratedEvent#extracoderule">Unused Code Rule</a>
was NOT going to be in effect, which everyone laughed at.
<br/><br/>
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="156859" darkBG="true" /> also went over the rules for the CDDC, which is a bit different this year, since the competitors
will only be appealing, not writing code or making designs.  One thing that will be very interesting will be that the reviewers
will submit appeal responses "in real time", so there will be a leader board for the round, showing the status of each appeal,
and whether it was accepted or rejected.  (Side note: even if an appeal is accepted, it still might not translate into a higher
score.)  The competitors relative rankings will be adjusted in real-time, I believe.
<br/><br/>
In one group of people chatting was <tc-webtag:handle coderId="152342" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="270505" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="346607" darkBG="true" />, and we talked about
our flights, and how looooong some of them were (especially John's).  When <tc-webtag:handle coderId="119676" darkBG="true" /> showed, after the announcements, 
he said it was the "longest flight of his life", even though it was probably about the same length as mine.  (I feel your pain,
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="119676" darkBG="true" />).  We're both on
"east coast time", both away from our families, both happy to be here, and both exhausted.  BTW, in case you're wondering, his laugh really is 
"all that".  (I wasn't able to get an mp3 of it, though -- maybe tomorrow ;)  I ran into <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7545675" darkBG="true" /> towards the end, and he told me
that he has already been to the Grand Canyon this trip.  I've never been there (but I've flown over it a bunch of times.)
<br/><br/>
Despite what I wrote before, there really were a lot of people who seemed interesting to talk to. I noticed a lot 
of other familiar faces who I didn't get a chance to talk to; hopefully the upcoming events will give me more
opportunities to meet them as well.  As the reception wound down, the four bloggers (<tc-webtag:handle coderId="8416646" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="21471147" darkBG="true" /> 
and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="21518515" darkBG="true" />) synced up and compared notes.  To our horror we saw that <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8416646" darkBG="true" /> had already written
<a href="/tc?module=Static&d1=tournaments&d2=tco06&d3=blogs&d4=Kawigi_1">gobs of text</a>, which was good motivation for the rest of us to come back to the hotel and capture our thoughts of
the evening.
<br/><br/>
Tomorrow morning is the first round of the algorithm competition, which I've been looking forward to -- I've <em>always</em>
wanted to watch the really great coders code (in algorithms at least.)  Specifically, I'm hoping to really study
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="10574855" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="272072" darkBG="true" /> and maybe, just maybe, a little of their magic will rub off on me
for my next SRM.
<br/><br/>
Respectfully submitted,<br/>
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="251184" darkBG="true" />
<br/><br/>
P.S. Darn time change, it's now 4:41AM PDT... right about now I'd be getting on the train -- so,
"to my peeps on the 743, greetings from Vegas!"
