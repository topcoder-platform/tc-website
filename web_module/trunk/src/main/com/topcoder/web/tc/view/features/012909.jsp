<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>[hitcher]</strong></td><td class="value">yoitsfrancis: you from the philippines?</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">Question #1: Lets say that I'm new to this type of track.  I have a feeling that in order for someone to win in this contest, you must have some experience in doing Specifications or similar tasks in Software Engineering.  Let's say that I don't have that</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">[hitcher]:  Maininly, specification (and concept) competitions deal with looking at a very high level at a clients idea and coming up with a technical solution.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">I notice that there are no good Specifications deliverables for us to study unlike Design and Development that is available in the TC Catalog because of the obvious nature that this type of competition is client specific.</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">Question #1a: Are there good books that you can train yourself to be good at this? Question #1b: Are there good websites or links that are worth studying for this type of competitions?</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">Question #1c: Is there more good resource that you might share that I missed?</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>[hitcher]</strong></td><td class="value">AssertionsOn: oh. got nosebleed.</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">[hitcher]: yup</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>[hitcher]</strong></td><td class="value">yoitsfrancis: kabayan :)</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: Not necessarily. Any exp. in building applications will be helpful, especially web applications.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: I mainly  rely on  past experiences for guiding my submissions, as well as my creativity. It helps a lot to think outside the box. </span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: Google and TopCoder are great references</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: Also, by looking at what past winners have produced greatly helps.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: Also, we have some resources on our wiki.  They are not 100% up to date to the current specification challenges, but the content should still be helpful for the basics of what we are looking for.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: Check this link:  http://www.topcoder.com/wiki/display/tc/Application+Requirements+Specifications</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">oh i see!</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">thanks!</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">Question #2: Let's say that I am equally good in Specifications, Architecture, Design, Development, Studio, Assembly and Testing.  Is Specifications a track is really really really worthwhile pursuing?</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: For conceptualization, see here: http://www.topcoder.com/wiki/display/tc/Conceptualization+Competitions</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">I know that this track is relavitely young compared to others but do you think money has already been made in Design and Development based on the vast number of components in the Catalog and you would recommend on shifting to Specifications?</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">And may I know the reason why?</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Plus, all, yo u have to remember that these challenges are not as technical as design and developement challenges, so you don't have to be too techincal. If you can explain your ideas in a straightforward way, you have a great chance of  winning.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: The specification track will have less trips to the TCO, but for every project we do we expect to have conceptualization, specification, and architecture work.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: Realistically, though we do have a large catalog, some amount of component work may be necessary for most projects... so I wouldn't write those off yet.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: Yes. Just look at the last 2 months of competitions. There has been a ton of Concept/Spec challenges been put out.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: Some people don't have the tech background for those types of competitions, and these would allow them to be involved in the TC process, as well as gain experience, feedback, and potentially some cash.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: Yes, indeed - we don't expect everyone from component competitions to be great at specification, and vice versa.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">that was @AssertionsOn, been a while since I messed with the arena chat interface =)</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">AdamSelene: Yup, I understand</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">Question #3: I saw fellow member's post in the forums and feel them that its hard to earn prize money at TopCoder.  Let's say that I have a full time job, work 8-12 hours a day earning $400-$900 a month.</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Exactly, I am not great at design and development competitions, but I love these competitions since I don't have to dive into all the technical aspects of an appllication. I can come up with some great ideas and present them in a meaningful way.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">(I love Software Engineering so if ever I land in Specifications that would be totally fine with me).  Is devoting full time in Specifications the answer?  If so, how would I make that shift from a full time job to a full time TopCoder competing member?</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">(Well, if you personally ask me on the shift thing, that is really really tough, especially that you don't get enough rest so if you have a better technique in shifting, I am all ears).</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: Competing full time at TopCoder is an important personal choice - you need to weigh the factors involved.  I don't think we can guarantee that any single type of competition will always have enough volume...</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: Remember there are some full time design/devs at TopCoder who rely on it for their only income. For us 40hr/week guys, it can be tough to keep up with them.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">AssertionsOn: good for you then!</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">AssertionsOn: you do the things you love!</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: we would love for that to be the case, but it is dependent on a lot of factors - client work volume, the overall economy, etc.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: I personally work 40+ a week and have children, so it is semi-stressful. But when you win, it is so worth it.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">AssertionsOn: yeah i feel you on that one</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene: I agree. Don't expect to put 1-2 hours into these compeititons. Usually, I put in about 10-20 per contest.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Plus, these competitions (as all of them) are very addictive. After my first one, I wanted to beat the other competitors so bad it kept me up at night trying to figure out how to beat them.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Cause with members like Mig-29, argolite, Ghostar, AleaActaEst, and others, it is both intimidating yet inspirational when you go against them and win.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">AssertionsOn: so, how does that feel?</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: What feeling are you referencing ?</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: Well, it feels good to think you can be in the same sentence with them (wrt Spec/Concept competitions). They are all great at what they do, and you hope to achieve their level of work.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">Question #4: Let's say that my happiness can be simply defined as me having $100,000 every year in my pocket (Hey, I'm totally happy with SRMs, but as long as we humans have a civilization and society, I need the money!), is Specifications the track to</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">go through compared to others?  And may I know the reason why?</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">So, let me ask the members a question: What keeps you from participating in these competitions?</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">guys, thats all the questions i have on my side</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">ivern</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: have you considered trying a competition or two and seeing how it works for you?</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">The lack of a real straightforward scorecard keeps me from competing.  </td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">I like a little bit of structure to the review process</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: Are you saying it is it worth it, to me personally?</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: We would like all our competition tracks to be very profitable for our members.  Given volume of work, we hope any track will be able to keep people happy.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: I think competiting in these is both fun and gives you great experience, even if you don't win.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: I would recommend picking a track based on your aptitude more than anything else</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">yoitsfrancis: I think that will give you the most money in the long run, all external factors being equal.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene: I agree with you here, about picking the right track for your personality and exp. </span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: In your experience are problems more in the scorecard or in inexperienced reviewers?  We'd like to fix both problems obviously</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene: For me, I can develop and design components, but not at the speed some of the current ones do it. But I know I can push out some specifications really quick.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>yoitsfrancis</strong></td><td class="value">AssertionsOn: answering your question, i have an affinity for a good design</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">I haven't actually gone through the review process in a spec. contest, but from what I saw in the scorecard, it was fairly subjective as to what the client liked</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">This is kind of intimidating, since it's hard to judge what the client is exactly looking for</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">The questions help, but it still can be confusing</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene: (wrt Ghostar issues) These are being worked actively by TC . It just takes a little time to get those issues worked out. But I have also had some frustrations along the way myself.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: Understood - so as a barrier to entry you expect clear scorecards and guidelines.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">jmpld40</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: Just so you are all aware, COncept and SPec comps are in the spotlight right now at TC and visit the threads or post here if you have ideas that should be on our radar</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">jmpld40</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: and we have a team dedicated to reviewing the challenges so far, and the feedback, and will implement changes</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">That would help.  I'm not sure I like the idea of having the client actively involved in the review process</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: Have you had a chance to look at the architecture scorecards that were posted?  Would posting scorecards in that format help for these challenges?  We didn't get much feedback on the arch cards.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">I did look them over, but didn't have time to get too in depth with them</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">I think that posting the scorecards will help, and I know that is being worked on, from what I have seen in the forums</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: But, would a presentation like that help?  Updating to have all guidelines, including scoring</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">I think so</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: "client in the review process" -&gt; Unfortunately, this is going to keep happening (I think). They need to be involved to make sure their business needs are met at this high of a level.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">I understand that, but it definitely makes the process more initimidating, and a little more chaotic</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: But they are getting members more involved in the review, so the comments/appeals/etc are getting extremely better.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">I think what we are moving towards is client review only at a high level during conceptualization.  I think everyone agrees with Ghostar that we need accountability and regularity in more detailed review</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene: Agreed</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">Asser</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: (Don't mess up my handle or you might get flagged for profanity ;) )</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">AssertionsOn:  It seems like Mig-29 is winning most of these.  Do you have a strategy to beat him?</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">AssertionsOn: I'm new to the chat room :)</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: Yes I have a strategy to beat them, but I can't give that away unfortunately. Then I would have everyone else beating me, and that would not be fun.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">AssertionsOn:  Do you find that a lot of these competitions are similar enough in nature to pull together different pieces of past competitions?  I do that quite a bit with architecture competitions, and it saves a bunch of time, and cuts down on mistakes</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">AssertionsOn:  I figured :)</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: I would expect to see that sooner than later - especially with conceptualization - many clients for instance need social networking features</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: There are small instances of reusing past competition content, but not really. I would say about 90% of my submission is brand new information. That is one area I need to improve in.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">AssertionsOn: That's kind of another barrier to entry, since there isn't a way (that I know of) to download past submissions</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><strong>barbarab</strong></td><td class="value">Are there any good examples of past specification winners available?  There are some great algo tutorials, but none for specifications or architecture that I can find.</td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: I do think TC has posted sample competitions up in the forums and included them in the distrobutions, so if you follow that you should be fine.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">barbarab: We are working on providing more examples, but it is a tough issue as the output for these competitions is often very client specific</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">AssertionsOn: I like to be able to see all of them, not just a single sample.  That way I can find ones that have similar goals to a new one posted.</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">barbarab: Not that I know of, to date. There is a sample set of deliverables, but I don't know if they are pubically available or not. </span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><strong>Ghostar</strong></td><td class="value">AdamSelene: I know we posted a couple of architecture submissions in the wiki awhile back.  I'm not sure if they are still there.  They were for internal TC systems</td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: I think that is fairly unlikely, again because of client concerns.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AssertionsOn</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">Ghostar: Agreed. I would like to see personally the differences between the Round 1 and Round 2 submissions, just to see how much difference there is.</span></td></tr>

<tr class="dark"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">You brought up the round concept so I will jump on that...</span></td></tr>

<tr class="light"><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">AdamSelene</span></td><td class="value"><span class="bigRed">The idea is that round 1 will flesh out use cases, and round 2 will provide the complete document.</span></td></tr>
