<br /><br />
Each challenge posted for an Assembly competition will carry a "placement point" value equivalent to the prize money for the contest. <A href="/tc?module=Static&d1=digital_run&d2=2008&d3=asmOverview">Placement Points</A> will be awarded based on the number of submissions that pass review. By registering for any Assembly competition, competitors agree to the items outlined on each contest's Project Overview page, including the Eligibility requirements and the Terms of Work, and the completion of all paperwork required by TopCoder.
<br /><br />
TopCoder reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to revoke any and all privileges associated with competing in Assembly competitions, and to take any other action it deems appropriate, for no reason or any reason whatsoever, including if TopCoder suspects competitors of cheating, tampering with the entry process, the operation of the Web site or the challenge process, or other violation of any rule. TopCoder reserves the right to cancel, terminate or modify this program if it is not capable of completion as planned for any reason, including infection by computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention or technical failures of any sort. TopCoder reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change any aspects of the Assembly competitions and the Assembly Cup, including but not limited to, these rules, the software methodology, the scorecard, the prize purse and the point distribution schedule, at any point during this program.
