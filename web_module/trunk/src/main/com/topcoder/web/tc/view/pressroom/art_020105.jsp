&#8220;Tomek&#8221; and &#8220;Pops&#8221; may be unfamiliar names to you, but in the world of coding competitions, they&#8217;re as big as rock stars.
<br /><br />
Now they&#8217;re at the top of the stack, according to their peers who
participate in online programming challenges at TopCoder.com, a mecca for
those willing to publicly test their programming chops.
<br /><br />
Submissions to the competitions (usually divided into
design/development and algorithm categories) undergo peer review before
they are ranked. There&#8217;s prize money and camaraderie&#8212;and participatants
love it.
<br /><br />
&#8220;At the very core of what we do is the belief that competition
is the best method of evaluating ability and delivering quantifiable
results,&#8221; says TopCoder&#8217;s president, Rob Hughes.
<br /><br />
&#8220;Tomek,&#8221; a.k.a. Tomasz Czajka, a Ph.D. candidate in computer
science at Purdue, began participating in online competitions when he
was in high school in Poland. He entered his first TopCoder competition
in 2003 and won the &#8220;TopCoder Open&#8221; two years running, as well as the
TopCoder Collegiate Challenge, earning about $98,000.
<br /><br />
Czajka says he was &#8220;just looking for any kind of programming
contest.&#8221; But since entering TopCoder, the adrenaline rush of
competition has become habit forming. &#8220;The problems are so interesting
so it is very stimulating,&#8221; he adds.
<br /><br />
&#8220;Pops,&#8221; a.k.a. Tim Roberts, an independent consultant in the
Chicago area, and TopCoder member since 2001, focuses on
design/development. Competing on TopCoder not only helps pay bills; his
consistently high rankings also give him a strong reference for
potential clients.
<br /><br />
Mike Morris, TopCoder&#8217;s VP of software development, says the
company has nearly 50,000 members in 160 countries, and about 1,500
compete weekly in online coding rounds.
<br /><br />
For Roberts, TopCoder isn&#8217;t just fun and games; it represents
the future. &#8220;I have been very active on the design side, trying to
improve the process over the years,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I find that many
companies talk about reuse but most don&#8217;t really do it.&#8221; He believes
TopCoder shows it can be done efficiently. &#8220;The stuff they develop is
[of] much higher quality than you&#8217;ll find in most companies.&#8221;
