<p><strong>GLASTONBURY, CT, June 7, 2006 &#151;</strong>TopCoder&#174;, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, skills assessment and competitive software development, today announced a partnership with the renowned Science Museum of Minnesota to promote the new TopCoder High School (TCHS) tournament to its members and high school students statewide. TopCoder and the Science Museum are partnering to help raise public awareness about the importance of encouraging math and science skill development among high school-age students. Future technologies and entire global industries will place a premium on algorithmic problem-solving abilities, and the TopCoder High School tournament will encourage and promote early interest in mathematical algorithms at a fun, grass roots level around the world. Global registration for high school-age students began in early June, with the inaugural regular season starting October 2, 2006 and running through to the championship finals in May 2007. Look for upcoming details and announcements online at <A href="http://www.topcoder.com/tchs">http://www.topcoder.com/tchs</A>.
<br><br>
"The Science Museum of Minnesota is deeply committed to fostering young people's interest in math and science. An early engagement in these critical areas can build their skills for a lifetime," said museum president Dr. Eric Jolly. "We hope partnering with TopCoder on this competition helps this generation of promising young minds become fluent in science&mdash;which is truly the literacy of the future."
<br><br>
TCHS will offer students the chance to compete as individuals and teams in a designated version of the highly regarded TopCoder competition arena. Young problem solvers will be able to win educational scholarships, valuable prizes and recognition while they learn in an online environment that is fun and exciting. Sponsorships for the competition will be available at the individual, local, national and international levels. All sponsorship proceeds beyond tournament operating costs will be entered into the overall scholarship prize pool.

<br><br>
"Given the competitive technological nature of today's world, TopCoder believes it is more important than ever to encourage, reward and recognize those who possess the skills to shape tomorrow's surroundings," said MaryBeth Luce, Programs Director for TopCoder, Inc. "By adding a tournament for high school-aged students, TopCoder is doing its part to ensure that there is a fun and competitive learning environment where students from around the world can build and showcase their talent."
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Overview</span><br>
Beginning in June 2006, TopCoder will hold weekly online events, called Single Round Matches (SRMs), which will be available only to high school-aged students. The SRMs will allow students to demonstrate their problem-solving skills by unraveling complex word problems through the use of a computer language - either Java, C++, C# or VB.Net. Students will be able to compete either as an individual or as part of a team representing their school, or, in case they are not affiliated with a school, representing their town or themselves. The worldwide TopCoder High School tournament will begin in early 2007 and will culminate in a large onsite final event at Purdue University in May 2007.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Prizes</span><br>
Based on support from individual, local, national and international sponsors, prizes will take the form of scholarships, hardware, software and educational materials. TopCoder will enlist the support of students to help spread the word and engage sponsors at the local level.
