<span class="bodySubTitle"><em>Architects Challenged to Create and Document Comprehensive Solutions to<br />Set of System Requirements</em></span></p>

<p>
<strong>GLASTONBURY, CT. &amp; SAN FRANCISCO, CA., July 1, 2008 &#151;</strong>TopCoder&reg;, Inc. and Think Services today announced that a live software competition will take place on-site at Dr. Dobb's Architecture &amp; Design World 2008, being held on July 21-24, 2008 at the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place in Chicago. The Software Architecture Challenge will provide attendees with a real-world exercise in architectural design, facing off on an even playing field with their peers to determine who can create and document the best comprehensive software solution to address a set of system requirements.
</p>

<p>
"We are happy to be partnering with TopCoder on this software architecture challenge and look forward to seeing the creative solutions developed by our attendees at Architecture &amp; Design World," remarked Amber Ankerholz, Conference Manager, Dr. Dobb's Events.
</p>

<p>
TopCoder tournaments are known worldwide as the most grueling, comprehensive test of skill in the field of competitive programming. The events allow competitors to solve complex algorithmic problems and design and develop working pieces of reusable software, and incorporate all current industry standard technologies, including Java, C++, C#, VB.NET, UML, J2EE and .NET.
</p>

<p>
During Architecture &amp; Design World attendees will be able to browse and score competitor submissions using the same scorecards and criteria that TopCoder uses to judge competitions for our clients, exposing participants and observers to a wide range of software architecture backgrounds and approaches. The competition allows software architects to explore the minds of their fellow attendees in ways that conversation typically does not allow. TopCoder's standardized deliverables enable an independent review board to judge and compare architectures - thus enabling competition and ranking. Submissions are judged on a wide-ranging variety of criteria - efficiency, security, concurrency, transactionality - as well as completeness and validity with respect to the system requirements. The winners will be determined based on the highest review score, and announced at the conclusion of the event.
</p>

<p>
"Competition is a powerful way to improve a software professional's architecture and design skills while having fun, " said Dave Messinger, chief architect of TopCoder. "Participants gain understanding of their individual capabilities compared to peers, as well as the wealth of feedback that results from the judging process and observation of how other competitors tackle the same problems in very different ways."
</p>

<p>
The challenge will take place both online and onsite leading up to the conclusion of Dr. Dobb's Architecture &amp; Design World, and is open to residents of the United States (excluding Puerto Rico) and Canada (excluding the province of Quebec), with free registration as a TopCoder member required to compete in the arena.
