        <h2>TopCoder Payment Methods and Requirements</h2>

<span class="bodySubtitle">How Algorithm Competition Payments Work</span><br>
You must provide the following in order for TopCoder to pay you for winnings earned from an Algorithm Competition: 
   <ul>
   <li><b>Valid member profile information</b> - Checks will be mailed via first class mail through the United States Postal Service, so please make sure your member profile is current.</li>
   <li><b>Notarized affidavit</b> - You must submit to TopCoder ONE notarized affidavit during your tenure as a competing TopCoder member.  A notarized affidavit is one that has been signed and stamped by a Notary Public (or similar official person in other countries).  A Notary Public is defined as "A person legally empowered to witness and certify the validity of documents and to take affidavits and depositions."  In the US and Canada, you can find a Notary Public at most post offices, banks and college/university registrar offices.  Outside the US and Canada, you can get your affidavit notarized at any US Embassy.<br>
   <b>Note</b>: Getting an affidavit notarized is a ONE TIME issue.  While you may incur costs to obtain a notarized affidavit, know that you will not have to do it again in the future.  TopCoder will not pay for any costs related to the notarization of affidavits.</li>
   </li>
   <li><b>Tax form</b> - You must submit to TopCoder the appropriate completed <A href="#taxform">tax form</A>.</li>
   <li><b>Affirmed affidavit</b> - Once you have a notarized affidavit on file with TopCoder, you can affirm online all future affidavits.  You must affirm affidavits within 60 days; otherwise they will expire and you will not receive payment for the associated contest. </li>
   </ul>
Please email questions to <A href="mailto:payments@topcoder.com">payments@topcoder.com</A>.
