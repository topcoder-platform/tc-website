            <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Overview</span><br/>
            The 2004 TCO Spectator Showdown will take place entirely at the TopCoder Open at the Santa Clara Marriott in Santa Clara, 
            CA on Friday, November 12, 2004.  Two (2) grand prizes will be awarded at the end of the day to the highest scorer on 
            each of the two (2) problems presented.</span>

			<p>All expenses to attend the TopCoder¨ Open are the responsibility of the individual.</p>

			<p><span class="bodySubtitle">Eligibility</span><br/>
			The TCO Spectator Showdown is open to all registered TopCoder members who are at least 18 years of age. 
			Individuals may register as a TopCoder member at the TopCoder Open.</p>

			<p>Employees of TopCoder, Inc., and members of the immediate families and/or persons living in the same household as 
			such persons, are ineligible to enter the tournament.  Finalists in the Algorithm and Component Competitions of the 
			TopCoder Open are also ineligible to enter the tournament.</p>

			<p><span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Structure</p>
			The allowable programming languages in the competition will be Java, C++, C# and VB.NET.  Each competition will have 2 phases Ð the Coding Phase and the System Testing Phase.  The following describes the different phases of competition: 

· The Coding Phase is a timed event where all contestants are presented with one of two possible questions.  A solution to a problem may be submitted multiple times, however a point penalty of 10% of the maximum value of the problem will be assessed for each submission.  Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened to the time it was submitted, regardless of the time it took to submit any previous solutions to that problem, if any.  

· The System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem. 

During the competition, the Coding Phase will last 30 minutes for each participant.  The System Testing Phase begins immediately upon submission of a solution.

About the Prizes
