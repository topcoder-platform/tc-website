The final round started out looking like an upset was in the making.  With a 250, a 500, and a 1200 point problem, competitors were particularly tempted to skip the medium, and try to strike the mother load.  But, the biggest story early on was reid, who submitted his easy problem in 9 minutes, 14 faster than second submitter ZorbaTHut, and before tomek had even compiled.  Finally, after 23 minutes, ZorbaTHut submitted his easy, and 2 minutes later, tomek got his in.  John Dethridge had given up by that point, and moved on to an imposing 1200 point problem.  As the seconds ticked by, reid, tomek and ZorbaTHut all worked hard on the medium problem, while John methodically moved forward on the hard, incrementally testing as he coded.  reid was the first to submit a second problem, getting 263 on the medium.  Over the next ten minutes, tomek's score slowly ticked down, and after about 50 minutes, his potential score on the first two problems was too low to beat reid.  But, he was able to submit fast enough to stay within a single challenge.  At this point, everyone assumed that neither reid nor tomek would have time to finish a 1200 point problem, and only John had a chance to take it away from reid.  With about 10 minutes to spare, John finally finished coding and passed all of the examples.  In the tense minutes that followed, John's score crept ever closer to  reid's, and everyone in the crowd wondered if we would be in time.  With only a couple minutes to spare, John submitted, taking the lead be a narrow margin.<br/><br/>

The competition was fierce, but today aksonov emerged as the victor of the TopCoder Collegiate Challenge 2004 Design competition.  aksonov, the last seed in the final round, bested adic by only the slimmest of margins: 0.59 points.  MPhk put in a strong showing, but fell behind the other two competitors.  In addition to this come from behind victory., aksonov will also take home the sizable $25,000 first prize.
</p>

<p>
All three competitors opened the first design round powerfully, each placing in the top 5.  Following up in the second round, they stayed on top of their competition, securing entrance to the finals.  Notably, aksonov submitted 4 designs in the first two rounds of the Collegiate Challenge Design competition, while also submitting a second place solution in the first Development round.  aksonov was the only finalist to compete in both the development and design competition.

A five hour struggle with bugs both large and small has ended, with roma finishing ahead of preben and gladius.  Along with a year's bragging rights, roma netted $15,000 in today's match.  The competition was largely quiet until the last two hours, with roma diving into the development addendum, and gladius exploring the Configuration Manager component.  The addendum proved to be a stumbling block for all competitors, but roma emerged victorious by a margin of nearly 15 points.  
</p>
	
<p>
The Component Development section of the TCCC04 began two months ago, on February 17th, with the posting of the development projects.  The first round ended ominously for preben, who placed last.  gladius did not fare much better, coming in only two places higher.  roma placed in the middle of the pack, but the first round was led by Standlove and aksonov (an eventual Design finalist).
</p>

<p>
Despite this slow start, the three competitors each submitted a solution for the second round of competition; roma and gladius for the Heartbeat component, and preben for the Source Control Client.  After the second round, these three stood alone as the qualifiers for the final round of the Component Development challenge.
