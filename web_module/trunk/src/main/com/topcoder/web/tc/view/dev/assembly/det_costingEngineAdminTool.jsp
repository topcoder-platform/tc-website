<span class="bigTitle">Costing Engine and Admin Tool</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The Costing Engine and Admin Tool applications work together to provide a platform for efficiently calculating and viewing Costs of Goods Sold (COGS).
<br><br>
The Costing Engine is a generic calculation engine that is communicated with by an ASP.NET Web Service.  It has no graphical user interface of its own.  The assembly for the Costing Engine will consist mostly of integrating components built via component competitions.  Specific tasks include:
<ul>
<li>Accept and validate price updates via a web service</li>
<li>Accept and validate costing requests via a web service</li>
<li>Calculate the requests using the generic engine</li>
</ul>

The Admin Tool is the graphical front-end to administer the Costing Engine.  The actual inputs to the generic engine will be configured using the Admin Tool.  All calculation results are also viewable through reports (which are standard ASP.NET pages with an 'export' option to Microsoft Excel using a pre-built component).  Admin Tool assembly will consist most of converting parts of an HTML prototype to ASP.NET and integrating components.
<br><br>
These applications are to be used by a TopCoder client.  All application documentation (including an assembly guide) will be available once registered.
<br><br>
NOTE: Please see eligibility requirements below.  Competitors must sign a non-disclosure agreement and pass a background check before being admitted into this competition.
<br><br>
