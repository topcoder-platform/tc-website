    <h2>Jack Hughes</h2>
    <h3><i>Founder and Chairman</i></h3>
    
    <p>
    In November 2000, Jack Hughes founded TopCoder on the premise that talent and skill are the determinant factors in the quality and utility of software -- and software has become central to the global economy. 
    </p>
    <p>
    In both his own programming experience and as co-founder and chairman of Tallán Inc., a provider of web-enabled business solutions, Hughes recognized that while successful projects were driven by superior programming skills, the talent was unqualified and largely unrecognized. TopCoder's mission is to create objective ratings that place high value on the programming industry's best and brightest, and build opportunity and community for programmers through ongoing programming tournaments and employer connections. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Under Hughes' tenure as chairman at Tallán, the company was recognized as one of the fastest-growing technology companies in North America four years in a row by consultancy firm Deloitte & Touche and by Inc. magazine for its outstanding performance. In 2000, CMGI, Inc. acquired a majority ownership of the company. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Hughes holds a B.S. degree in computer science from Boston College. He is director and vice chair of the executive committee and chair of the strategy committee for the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation.
