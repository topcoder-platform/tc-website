         <h2>Conditions of Participation</h2>
         
         <p>By participating in the tournament, you agree to be bound by these rules and to all decisions of TopCoder, which 
         are final, binding and conclusive in all matters.</p>

         <h3><font color="#CC0000">Contestants must not cheat. All ideas for any code and/or challenge submitted must be 
         the contestant's alone.</font></h3>

         <p>Winners in each round of competition will be those competitors who win the most points in their respective rooms. 
         All decisions relating to the viability of submissions, the ranking of submissions and all other matters pertaining to 
         the tournament shall be within the sole discretion of TopCoder or its designee and shall be final and binding in all respects.</p>

         <p>Prizewinners will be notified via e-mail within 10 days of the completion of the Online Round #1 that they have 
         won a prize.  Contestants who advance to Online Round #4 must complete the following documents online by 9:00 PM 
         EST on Wednesday, March 17, 2004:</p>

         <ul>
         <li>Competitor questionnaire - the questions and responses will be published in the 2004 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge Guide</li>
         <li>Travel form - provides TopCoder with the appropriate travel information in the event you advance to the onsite tournament rounds</li>
         </ul>

         <p>Contestants who advance to Online Round #4 must also complete the following documents and return them to TopCoder 
         by Wednesday, March 24, 2004:</p>

         <ul>
         <li>Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release (must be notarized unless you already have a notarized 
         affidavit on file with TopCoder)</li>
         <li>Applicable tax form (unless your tax form is already on file with TopCoder)</li>
         </ul>

         <p>Prizes will be presented within 60 days of making an eligibility determination. Unclaimed or undeliverable prizes 
         will not be awarded.  Competitors who do not submit the required information listed above by the applicable deadlines 
         will forfeit their prizes.</p>

         <p>As a condition of participation in the tournament, all information provided by you in your TopCoder member profile 
         must be comprehensive, accurate and up-to-date. TopCoder may require you to complete an additional registration form 
         to register for the tournament. In order to be eligible to participate in the tournament, you must have completed any and 
         all registration forms required by TopCoder.</p>

         <p>As a condition of winning and redeeming a cash prize, winners will be required to return by Wednesday, March 17, 
         2004 a completed (i) competitor questionnaire, and (ii) travel form; and by Wednesday, March 24, 2004 a completed 
         (i) notarized Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release, and (ii) IRS Form W-9 or W-8BEN, as appropriate, 
         if one is not already on file with TopCoder. In completing the Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release, a 
         winner (i) confirms his/her eligibility, (ii) represents and warrants that he/she has not cheated; that the idea for the 
         code and/or challenge submitted is his/hers alone, (iii) verifies the accuracy of the demographic information submitted 
         to, and contained in, the TopCoder member database, (iv) authorizes TopCoder to publicize the tournament's results, (v) 
         agrees to sign any applicable forms required by tax authorities, (vi) licenses to TopCoder rights to all information submitted 
         during the tournament (including rights to source code and other executables), and (vii) releases TopCoder from liability 
         arising out of any prize won. TopCoder requires contestants to complete the Form W-9 or W-8BEN for tax reporting 
         purposes. If prize notification is returned as undeliverable, or if the winner fails to return the Affidavit, or the W-9 or 
         W-8BEN, as specified, the winner will be disqualified and the prize money won by the disqualified winner will be forfeited. 
         Providing false information in the registration process or in the required forms described in this paragraph will disqualify 
         a winner.</p>

         <p>By participating in a tournament and redeeming a prize, a winner releases and agrees to hold harmless TopCoder, its 
         affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotion agencies, sponsors, and prize suppliers, and all of their respective 
         directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents, from and against any and all liability for any loss, property 
         damage or damage to person, including without limitation, death and injury, due in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, 
         from or arising out of participation in this tournament, or participation in any tournament-related activity, or the receipt, 
         use or misuse of a prize. TopCoder specifically disclaims all liability associated with, and makes no warranties with regard 
         to, any prize given.</p>

         <p>In addition, all prizewinners agree to cooperate with TopCoder's publicity efforts, without further compensation. This 
         includes the agreement to use their name, handle, address (city and state) and likeness for publicity purposes, where legal, 
         for this or similar future tournaments, and to use the statements made by, or attributed to, the winners relating to TopCoder 
         and any and all rights to said use, without further compensation.  Furthermore, all prizewinners agree to promptly notify 
         TopCoder if a third-party contacts the prizewinner regarding employment opportunities and/or media interest as a result 
         of the prizewinner’s participation in the tournament.</p>

         <p>TopCoder reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to revoke any and all privileges associated with competing in this 
         tournament, and to take any other action it deems appropriate, for no reason or any reason whatsoever, including if TopCoder 
         suspects competitors of cheating, tampering with the entry process, the operation of the Web site, or the tournament process, 
         or otherwise being in violation of the rules. TopCoder reserves the right to cancel, terminate or modify the tournament if it is 
         not capable of completion as planned for any reason, including infection by computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized 
         intervention or technical failures of any sort.</p>
