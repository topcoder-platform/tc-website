               <blockquote>
                  <h2>Conditions of Participation</h2>
                  <p>By participating in the tournament, you agree to be bound by these rules and to all decisions of TopCoder, which are final,
                  binding and conclusive in all matters.</p>
                  <h3><font color="#CC0000">Contestants must not cheat. All designs and/or development submissions must be the work of the contestant alone.</font></h3>
                  <p>Winners in each round of competition will be those competitors who win the most points in their respective rooms. All decisions
                  relating to the viability of submissions, the ranking of submissions and all other matters pertaining to the tournament shall be within
                  the sole discretion of TopCoder or its designee and shall be final and binding in all respects.</p>

                  <p>All 50 advancers from Round 2 must complete and return the following documents to TopCoder NO LATER THAN 6:00pm on
                  Monday, November 17th:<br />
                  <ul>
                  <li>Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release (must be notarized unless you already have a notarized affidavit on file
                  with TopCoder) - a faxed copy is acceptable</li>
                  <li>Travel form, including confirmation that you will be permitted to travel to New York City in the event you are a grand-prize
                  winner.  If you live outside the U.S., this includes providing TopCoder with confirmation that you have a valid passport and any necessary Visa</li
                  <li>Applicable tax form (unless your tax form is already on file with TopCoder)</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prizes will be presented within 60 days of making an eligibility determination. Unclaimed or undeliverable prizes will not be
                  awarded.  Competitors who do not submit the required information listed above by Monday, November 17th will forfeit their prizes.</p>

                  <p>As a condition of participation in the tournament, all information provided by you in your TopCoder member profile must be
                  comprehensive, accurate and up-to-date. TopCoder may require you to complete an additional registration form to register for the
                  tournament. In order to be eligible to participate in the tournament, you must have completed any and all registration forms
                  required by TopCoder.</p>

                  <p>As a condition of winning and redeeming a cash prize, winners will be required to return by Monday, November 17th a completed
                  (i) Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release (which must be notarized unless a notarized affidavit is already on file
                  with TopCoder), (ii) travel form, and (iii) IRS Form W-9 or W-8BEN, as appropriate, if one is not already on file with TopCoder.
                  In completing the Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release, a winner (i) confirms his/her eligibility, (ii) represents
                  and warrants that he/she has not cheated; that the idea for the code and/or challenge submitted is his/hers alone, (iii) verifies the
                  accuracy of the demographic information submitted to, and contained in, the TopCoder member database, (iv) authorizes TopCoder to
                  publicize the tournament's results, (v) agrees to sign any applicable forms required by tax authorities, (vi) licenses to TopCoder rights
                  to all information submitted during the tournament (including rights to source code and other executables), and (vii) releases TopCoder
                  from liability arising out of any prize won. TopCoder requires contestants to complete the Form W-9 or W-8BEN for tax reporting
                  purposes. If prize notification is returned as undeliverable, or if the winner fails to return the Affidavit, or the W-9 or W-8BEN, as
                  specified, the winner will be disqualified and the prize money won by the disqualified winner will be forfeited. Providing false
                  information in the registration process or in the required forms described in this paragraph will disqualify a winner.</p>

                  <p>By participating in a tournament and redeeming a prize, a winner releases and agrees to hold harmless TopCoder, CRPF, their
                  affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotion agencies, sponsors, and prize suppliers, and all of their respective directors,
                  officers, employees, representatives and agents, from and against any and all liability for any loss, property damage or damage to
                  person, including without limitation, death and injury, due in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, from or arising out of
                  participation in this tournament, or participation in any tournament-related activity, or the receipt, use or misuse of a prize.
                  TopCoder and CRPF specifically disclaim all liability associated with, and makes no warranties with regard to, any prize given.</p>

                  <p>In addition, all prizewinners agree to cooperate with TopCoder's and CRPF�s publicity efforts, without further compensation. This
                  includes the agreement to use their name, handle, address (city and state) and likeness for publicity purposes, where legal, for this or
                  similar future tournaments, and to use the statements made by, or attributed to, the winners relating to TopCoder and CRPF and any and
                  all rights to said use, without further compensation.  Furthermore, all prizewinners agree to promptly notify TopCoder if a third-party
                  contacts the prizewinner regarding employment opportunities and/or media interest as a result of the prizewinner�s participation in the
                  tournament.</p>

                  <p>TopCoder reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to revoke any and all privileges associated with competing in this tournament,
                  and to take any other action it deems appropriate, for no reason or any reason whatsoever, including if TopCoder suspects competitors
                  of cheating, tampering with the entry process, the operation of the Web site, or the tournament process, or otherwise being in violation
                  of the rules. TopCoder reserves the right to cancel, terminate or modify the tournament if it is not capable of completion as planned for
                  any reason, including infection by computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention or technical failures of any sort.</p>

                  <p>The tournament is void in whole or in part where prohibited by law.</p>

                  <p>A list of tournament winners by coder handles will be available on the web site at <A href="http://www.topcoder.com/crpf ">www.topcoder.com/crpf</A> and will be
                  displayed for at least 3 months after the end of the tournament.</p>
