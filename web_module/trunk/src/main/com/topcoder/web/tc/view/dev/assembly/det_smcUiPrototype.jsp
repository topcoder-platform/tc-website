<span class="bigTitle">SMC UI Prototype</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The SMC (Site Management Console) is a Server Client Application which allows users to create Calendar Entries and create reports. Part of an existing application called Product Management Console, the SMC will coordinate and organize different marketing and sales activities to create new landing pages for an eCommerce site. The SMC will also generate reports that the customer can use during its weekly meetings.
<br><br>
For this competition, we need teams to build a .NET 2.0 thick client prototype coded in C#. The prototype has three main parts:
<ol>
<li>Creating, changing and deleting different events, including:
  <ul>
  <li>Content</li>
  <li>Digital Operations</li>
  <li>Corporate Marketing</li>
  <li>Marketing</li>
  <li>Merchandising</li>
  <li>Planning</li>
  <li>Technology</li>
  <li>Non-Landing Pages</li>
  <li>Landing Page</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Creating Reports.</li>
<li>Printing the calendars and reports in different layouts</li>
</ol>

See the attached screenshots for more information on the user interface of the prototype:

<ul>
<li>The application will allow users to initiate a new event and its key dates and deliverables:<br>
- for example, creating a new <A href="i/development/assembly/smcUiPrototype/landingpages_key-dates_n.png" target="_blank">landing page</A></li>
<li>These events will be displayed in a calendar interface sortable by requirement:<br>
- see the <A href="i/development/assembly/smcUiPrototype/reporting_creative-calendar_n.png" target="_blank">creative calendar</A></li>
<li>as well as by date:<br>
- by <A href="i/development/assembly/smcUiPrototype/calendar_day_n.png" target="_blank">day</A><br>
- by <A href="i/development/assembly/smcUiPrototype/calendar_month_n.png" target="_blank">month</A><br>
- by <A href="i/development/assembly/smcUiPrototype/calendar_quarter_n.png" target="_blank">quarter</A></li>
<li>The calendar will also display key deliverables and plans by date:<br>
- <A href="i/development/assembly/smcUiPrototype/calendar_week-launchplan_n.png" target="_blank">launch plan by week</A></li>
<li>The application will also allow users to sort these events and print them in different formats:<br>
- <A href="i/development/assembly/smcUiPrototype/print_n.png" target="_blank">print screen</A></li>
</ul>

More information on functionality and user interface will be available to registered competitors.
<br><br>
This prototype is to be used by a TopCoder client. All prototype documentation will be available once registered. 
<br><br>
NOTE: Please see eligibility requirements below. Competitors must sign a non-disclosure agreement before being admitted into this competition.  If you have already submitted a non-disclosure agreement for another assembly competition you are not required to submit another one.
<br><br>

<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
In this assembly competition teams will be responsible for creating a .Net 2.0 WinForms application based on wire frames and supporting requirements.  The wire frames dictate the layout and functionality of the application.  Competitors are responsible for converting the wire frames into a functioning user interface.  The winning submission from this competition will be used as the UI in another assembly competition.
<br><br>
This competition involves assembling the Site Management Console Prototype WinForms. TopCoder will deliver the wire frames, graphics, CSS and Excel Sheets for test data.
