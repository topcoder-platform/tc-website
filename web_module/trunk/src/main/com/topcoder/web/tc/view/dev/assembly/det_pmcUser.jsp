<span class="bigTitle">PMC User</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The PMC User is part of Product Management Console, a Server Client Application that allows users to import, change and export products to an eCommerce Application from various existing corporate Divisions and Brands.
<br><br>
The application is used by different user groups managed through an existing active directory. Different kinds of user groups have different rights to see or change data.
<br><br>
The Product Management Console is composed of a series of components built through the TopCoder Component Production methodology. 
<br><br>
TopCoder is providing the original MS Access Application (which the client is using at the moment) and the existing database for the registrants to use as a reference.

Specific tasks of the PMC User are:
<ul>
<li>Start application</li>
<li>Create and import base data<br>
Creating base data Excel sheet; import wizard to import Excel sheets into DB</li>
<li>Create and edit product data and reference data</li>
<li>Administration, including create users, delete users, change users and define workflows</li>
</ul>

Most of the code for the application is contained within components; however, some functions are required in the assembly code. Teams will be responsible for configuration of the components, configuration of the application and conversion of prototype (to content templates) according to the specified application architecture designs. 
<br><br>
This application is to be used by a TopCoder client. All application documentation will be available once registered. 
<br><br>
<b>NOTE:</b> Please see eligibility requirements below. Competitors must sign a non-disclosure agreement before being admitted into this competition.  If you have already submitted a non-disclosure agreement for another assembly competition you are not required to submit another one.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
This assembly competition will consist of prototype conversion, component integration, and extensive unit testing to ensure correct operation. 
<br><br>
This competition involves assembling the Product Management Console. The greatest part of the application is implemented by custom and generic components that have recently been completed. The main tasks will involve configuring these components and integrating them with the .Net Prototype. Teams will be required to commit their in-progress work to TopCoder's Subversion repository.
