<span class="bigTitle">Privacy Policy of TopCoder</span>
<p>
This privacy policy ("Policy"), updated as of September 15, 2009, describes the information we collect from users of Our website ("You" or "Your") and how we use it.  This Policy applies to all TopCoder-related websites owned by TopCoder, Inc. ("TopCoder", "We", "Us" or "Our"), except if a privacy policy or statement posted on a TopCoder website states that it will apply in addition to or in lieu of this Policy. By using a TopCoder website, You consent to the use of Your personal information as described in this document and accept the Terms and Conditions of Use for such websites. <br><br>
TopCoder values privacy as much as we value programmers, and therefore we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users.  We want to provide a safe, secure user experience.  We will use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private.  Your personal information is immediately transferred from our Web server to behind our firewall, where it remains isolated from a direct connection to the Internet.  By using this Web site, and in doing so accepting the Terms and Conditions of Use under which you may use this Web site (see <A href="/tc?module=Static&d1=about&d2=terms">Terms and Conditions of Use</A>), you consent to the use of your personal information as described in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>
TopCoder values privacy as much as We value programmers, and therefore We are committed to protecting Your privacy. TopCoder wants to provide a safe, secure user experience. We will use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that thepersonal information You submit to us remains private. Your personal information is immediately transferred from Our web server to behind Our firewall, where it remains isolated from a direct connection to the Internet.  </p>
<p>
This Policy and Our security measures are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. You should understand, however, that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. 
</p><p>
Your information is used only for the purposes as set forth herein. TopCoder will not sell, rent, or lease Your personal information to others except as may be otherwise described in this privacy policy without first obtaining Your permission. However, TopCoder may share the Your personal information with third-parties without Your permission to: (1) respond to duly authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities; (2) comply with any law, rule, regulation subpoena or court order; (3) help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights and properties of TopCoder (including subsidiaries, affiliates and clients); (4) to protect the personal safety of TopCoder employees and third parties on TopCoder property or at TopCoder events; and (5) to help enforce this Policy, the Terms of Use, to enforce competition rules and requirements, and to protect the security of any TopCoder website or other business interest. 
</p>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Information About All TopCoder Visitors</span><br>
We gather information about all users of Our websites collectively, including without limitation, (a) their Internet domain and their computer IP address, (b) what area users visit most frequently, (c) the type of browser and operating system they use and (d) if the user linked to our Web site from another Web site, the address of that other Web site. We use this information for analyzing trends and statistics, fraud protection, improving Our services, planning Web site enhancements and measuring overall Web site effectiveness. From time to time We may reveal general, anonymous, aggregated statistical information about our Web site, services and users, such as the number of visits and users and what Web site features they use.  
<br><br>

<span class="bodySubtitle">Information About You Specifically</span><br>
If You choose to register as a member in order to participate in TopCoder competitions, You will provide us with additional information about Yourself, including Your name, a self-chosen handle (public login name), email address and a full mailing address. If You are a winner, for legal purposes We will also request confirmation of Your date of birth. In addition, if You are a U.S. person (including U.S. resident aliens), We will request Your social security number (or taxpayer identification number) on IRS form W-9. If You are a winner, and You are not a U.S. person, We will request a Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding on IRS form W-8BEN. We use this information to verify Your eligibility to participate in specific competitions, and to contact You and properly notify the IRS should You be a winner. 
<br><br>
During a competition, a TopCoder member who is participating in the competition will be shown and identified by their chosen handles. A TopCoder member's handle, rating, country, school, competition statistics, date registered, winnings to date, skill set, and personal quote will be publicly available to visitors to the TopCoder Web site and to users of competition applications. Certain competitions may permit individuals to view the competition and members who are participating in the competition without identifying themselves. 
<br><br>
The handles of the members who win a competition will be posted on the TopCoder website and may be released to governmental authorities as required by law. 
<br><br>
The personal information You provide must be accurate and complete and all registration details (where applicable) must contain Your real name, full mailing address and other requested details. TopCoder provides members with access to the personal information that the member has provided to TopCoder in the member's profile and the ability to review, revise, edit, correct or delete the information. To protect Our members' privacy and security, TopCoder requires unique passwords and handles before permitting access to a member's profile information. TopCoder recommends that You take every precaution in protecting Your personal information when You are on the Internet by, for example, changing passwords often, using a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords and using a secure browser. 
<br><br>
You are solely responsible for the accuracy of Your personal information and We may take any action with respect to Your personal information we deem necessary or appropriate if We believe it may cause Us to suffer any loss, liability or commercial damage.  
<br>
<br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">How TopCoder uses Your information</span><br>
TopCoder may use Your information to:
<ul>
<li>Communicate with you about products, services and competitions: From time to time, We may use Your contact information to alert You to new competitions and communicate news, events and reminders. If You do not want to be alerted of any of these items, uncheck all boxes in the "Email Notifications" section on the second page of the registration form, or send an e-mail to support@topcoder.com  asking to be removed from email notifications. </li>
<li>Provide service, support, member feedback and to engage members to provide services, support and feedback; </li>
<li>Personalize some TopCoder websites and to provide the ability for members to create personal profile pages: As a TopCoder member, You may choose to create a more extensive profile that includes Your work and educational experience, a picture, etc... as well as Your relevant technology skills. You have the ability to update and change this information at any time and We encourage You to keep it updated.  In addition, TopCoder will use Your performance in competitions to update certain areas of Your profile, such as Your rating.</li>
<li>To conduct questionnaires and surveys in order to provide better services to members and customers: At registration as a member and/or for a competition, We may ask You to participate in a brief questionnaire or survey.</li> 
<li>To support recruitment inquiries by TopCoder and its customers: Provided the member has elected to receive such inquiries, TopCoder may provide access to Your personal information to certain clients, sponsors and subscribing employers to allow them to contact You regarding employment opportunities based upon Your skills, experience and success in TopCoder competitions. If You are contacted, other than through TopCoder, by a third-party regarding employment opportunities and/or media interest as a result in Your participation in TopCoder competitions, You agree to promptly notify TopCoder of such contact. </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
TopCoder may also share Your personal information with third parties, agents and contractors in order to provide a requested service or transaction. For example, TopCoder may need to disclose certain personal information to payment agents in order to facilitate a payment of prize money to You. We will only provide such third parties with the minimum amount of personal information necessary to complete the service or transaction. 
<br><br>
TopCoder may share Your information with third parties when You engage in certain activities on TopCoder-owned websites, such as participating in competitions which are sponsored by third parties. When You participate in such activities, you will, at the time of participation, either be required or have the option to agree that the sponsor may have access to Your personal information, including for purposes of employment recruiting and/or intellectual property (e.g., copyright, trademark) ownership verification and registration. 
<br><br>
TopCoder may also take a member's personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating the member's information with other members' information), or by removing characteristics (such as a member's name) that make the information personally identifiable to the member (de-personalizing the information). There are no restrictions under this Policy upon TopCoder's ability to aggregate or de-personalize a member's personal information, and TopCoder may use and/or share the resulting non-personally identifiable information with third parties in any way. 
<br><br>

TopCoder makes forum-style discussion topics available. Most forum topics and threads are available for viewing by users of the TopCoder website, however, in order to participate in a discussion, a user must log in under their handle. Please remember that any information You disclose in these areas becomes public information, and You should always exercise caution when disclosing any personal information in a public forum.  
<br><br>
