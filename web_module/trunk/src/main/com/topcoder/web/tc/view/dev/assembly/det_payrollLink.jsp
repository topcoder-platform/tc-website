<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The client is a Per-Diem medical professional staffing firm that provides rated medical personnel online.  Facilities, or "Providers" - hospitals, nursing homes, and other care facilities -- and nurses, or "Professionals," register on the client website to become members of the client's online community.  Providers post shifts with skill, licensure and ratings requirements, qualified Professionals are alerted to these available shifts, and interested Professionals respond.  The system is attempting to create an economy of scale, and intends to deploy nationwide.  The system is prepared to handle approximately 5,000 Professionals and Providers brokering services online.
<br><br>
To allow client personnel to focus on individual competencies, and to prepare for an anticipated explosion in scale, the client has contracted with a third party vendor to supply Payroll and Human Resources services.  The Payroll Link Project will synchronize the client's Payroll, Employee and Facility data with its partner's processing systems.  The third-party vendor will fetch downloadable reports from a new, secure addition to the client's website.
<br><br>
Features of the application:<br>
<ul>
<li>A suite of new, secure, JSP web pages to deliver the Payroll Link content</li>
<li>A new user role to accommodate the 3rd party vendor</li>
<li>Use Jasper to deliver configurable reports</li>
<li>Produce invoices that may be imported by QuickBooks Pro 2005</li>
<li>Reports of 3 types are delivered via the web<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Payroll Data
	<li>Employee Data
	<li>Facility Data
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Role-based access controls</li>
<li>A job scheduling module to produce reports periodically</li>
</ul>
