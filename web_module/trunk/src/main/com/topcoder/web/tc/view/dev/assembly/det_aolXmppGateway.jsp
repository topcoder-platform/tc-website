<br><br>
<span class="bigRed">The XMPP Gateway project has been re-launched with a full timeline. All of the competition kinks have been worked out, so here is your chance to earn $30,000 and build an exciting enterprise system that could be used by millions of people.</span>
<br><br>
The XMPP Gateway provides a communication interface to the AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) platform that is compliant with eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). This allows XMPP and Jabber clients to sign on to the AIM network for instant messaging.
<br><br>
The XMPP Gateway is composed of a series of components built through the TopCoder Component Production methodology. Additionally, a set of components has been developed to utilize the AIM SDK. 
<br><br>
Specific tasks of this application include:
<ul>
<li>Signing on to AIM</li>
<li>Displaying the Buddy List/Roster</li>
<li>Managing Contacts</li>
<li>Sending and Receiving Instant Messages</li>
<li>Sharing Buddy Icons</li>
<li>Hosting and Joining Group Chat</li>
</ul>

The application does <u><b>not</b></u> include:
<ul>
<li>Streaming of Audio or Video</li>
<li>Direct Connect to other clients</li>
</ul>
All code for the application is contained within components. Teams will be responsible for configuration of the components, configuration of the application, conversion of prototype (to content templates) and evaluation/enhancement of components. 
<br><br>
These applications are to be used by a TopCoder client. All application documentation (including an assembly guide) will be available once registered. 
<br><br>
NOTE: Please see eligibility requirements below. Competitors must sign a non-disclosure agreement before being admitted into this competition. 
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
This assembly competition will consist of prototype conversion, component integration, and extensive unit testing to ensure correct operation.
