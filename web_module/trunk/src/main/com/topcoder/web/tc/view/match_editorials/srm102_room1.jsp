<span class="bodySubtitle">SRM 102</span><br>Monday, July 1, 2002
<br/><br/>

<span class="bigTitle">Room 1 Review</span>

<P>
SRM 102 was the first TopCoder match without cash prizes, although many of the Room One regulars, along with 350 other coders
competed anyways.  Hopefully this strong interest in single-round matches among the top members (and indeed among all members) will
continue in the upcoming weeks and months.
</P>

<P>
The coding pace in room one is usually fast and furious, and SRM 102 was no exception.  <B>John Dethridge</B> and <B>ZorbaTHut</B> both pulled out
to an early lead by solving the Level 1 problem in about 4 minutes for scores of 245.17 and 245.86 respectively out of a possible
250.  <B>radeye</B> and <B>Yarin</B> followed a minute later for 243.34 and 241.38 points.  <B>jonmac</B> was the last person to finish this first
problem, but it only took him 10 minutes, and he still had a very respectable 221.74 points for his effort.
</P>

<P>
Everyone then moved on to the Level 2 problem.  <B>radeye</B> moved into the lead at 19 minutes into the competition with his Level 2
submission which earned him 414.35 out of a possible 500 points, and 657.69 points in total.  <B>Yarin</B> was the next to submit (4
minutes later), giving him 615.76 total points. <B>ZorbaTHut</B>, <B>benetin</B>, and <B>SnapDragon</B> were in a close battle for third after their
Level 2 submissions with 568.94, 564.90, and 559.66 points respectively. malpt opened the level 2 problem, but decided to move on to
(and solve) the level 3 problem first for 584.27 points before returning to finish and then submit (and re-submit) the level 2
problem for 150 points.  <B>John Dethridge</B> used dynamic programming (instead of brute force) to solve the level 2 problem, and this may
have cost him some time, as he required 45 minutes to complete it and only received 223.15 points.
</P>

<P>
<B>radeye</B> was able to preserve his lead with a very fast level 3 solution at 34 minutes into the competition, for 793.13 out of a
possible 1000 points.  This gave him an astounding 1450.82 out of 1750 possible points.  <B>ZorbaTHut</B> completed a level 3 solution in
slightly less time, for 800.85 points, but his combined score after the coding phase was 1369.79 putting him in second place.
<B>SnapDragon</B> was in third after coding with 1330.99 points, and <B>benetin</B> was fourth with 1251.67 points.  <B>John Dethridge</B> gained ground
on the final problem, finishing the coding phase in fifth with 1122.89 points.  Both <B>dmwright</B> and <B>jonmac</B> were unable to complete the
level 3 problem.
</P>

<P>
Only one challenge resulted in the coding phase, coming from <B>John Dethridge</B> on <B>jonmac</B>'s level 2 solution.  <B>ZorbaTHut</B> was not able to
pass the system test for his level 2 solution, nor was <B>SnapDragon</B> for his level 3 solution. This allowed <B>benetin</B> to move into second
place, and <B>John Dethridge</B> to move into third, while <B>radeye</B> was able to hang on to first place, receiving an impressive rating gain
of 134 points.
