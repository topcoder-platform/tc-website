            <h3>Do I need a visa?</h3>
            <p>All travelers entering the United States must present either a passport or a visa. If you do NOT have a passport, or you are from a country that does NOT participate in the Visa Waiver Program, you must apply for a visa.</p>
            <p>The following countries DO NOT require a visa to enter the United States:<br />
            <a target="_blank" href="<tc-webtag:linkTracking link='http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/without/without_1990.html#countries' refer='tco08_getVisa' />">http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/without/without_1990.html#countries</a></p>
            
            <h3>Why should I get it early?</h3>
            <p>Getting your travel documents well in advance of your travel dates is important. If you require a visa, the application process could be lengthy. In some countries, it can take over a month. <a target="_blank" href="/tc?module=Static&d1=features&d2=073007">We strongly suggest you begin the process as soon as possible.</A></p>
            
            <h3>What is involved in applying for a visa?</h3>
            <p>The visa application process is an interview at the US Embassy explaining your trip to the United States. You should apply for a travel/tourist visa and be sure to let them know that you are only staying in the United States for a short time. It's a good idea to have the following information available at your interview:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An official letter of invitation from TopCoder (please see below)</li>
                <li>Proof of residency in your home country</li>
                <li>Evidence of employment and community ties, such as a copy of your marriage license or university documents</li>
                <li>Your resume</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How do I get an official invitation letter from TopCoder?</h3>
            <p><strong>As stated in the rules, all competitors must request a visa invitation letter by 5:00 PM EDT (GMT/UTC -4) on Wednesday, March 12, 2008.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Algorithm Competitors:</strong> All competitors who advance to Online Round 2 will receive a request form to fill out if they require a letter. As soon as a competitor fills out the form in its entirety, the letter will be shipped out by FedEx International Priority mail.</p>
            <p><strong>Component Competitors:</strong> All competitors who pass submission on at least one component will receive a request form to fill out if they require a letter. As soon as a competitor fills out the form in its entirety, the letter will be shipped out by FedEx International Priority mail.</p>
            <p><strong>Marathon Competitors:</strong> All competitors who advance to Online Round 2 will receive a request form to fill out if they require a letter. As soon as a competitor fills out the form in its entirety, the letter will be shipped out by FedEx International Priority mail.</p>
            <p><strong>Studio Design Competitors:</strong> All competitors who earned TCO SDC placement points by February 8, 2008 will receive a request form to fill out if they require a letter. As soon as a competitor fills out the form in its entirety, the letter will be shipped out by FedEx International Priority mail.</p>
