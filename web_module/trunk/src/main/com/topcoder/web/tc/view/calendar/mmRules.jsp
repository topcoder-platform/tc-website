            <strong>When to start the Competition Round</strong><br />
            TopCoder members must register for the competition round. Registration may occur at any time
            from.
            <rsc:item name="reg_start_time" row="<%=rsr%>" format="MM.dd.yyyy hh:mm a z"/>

            All competitors who have registered for the competition round will immediately be given
            access
            to the competition problem statement for that round. The competition round will begin
            at
            <rsc:item name="coding_start_time" row="<%=rsr%>" format="MM.dd.yyyy hh:mm a z"/>
            which is the
            earliest time that any member will be given
            access to the problem statement.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            <strong>Upon Entering a Marathon Match</strong><br />
            All competitors registered for a specific Marathon Match will see a Submit option 
            for that event. Clicking the Submit link will take you to a page that will 
            allow you to paste in a solution, select the proper language and either submit 
            (for compilation and testing) or save your code. When the Submit button is 
            selected, the code will be immediately compiled. Any compilation messages 
            or errors will be shown in the Messages Area. If the compilation was 
            successful, the submission will then be placed on a queue for automated testing. 
            Example test cases will not be tested. When your submission has been processed,
            you will receive an email indicating such and your place in the standings will 
            be adjusted accordingly. During the submission phase, overall ranking and 
            provisional score are the only pieces of information that will be made 
            available. A given competitor will only be allowed to submit once every 
            4 hours.  Additionally, if a competitor has a pending submission on the 
            testing queue it must finish testing before they may submit again.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            Clicking the Test Examples button will immediately compile and place your 
            submission on a queue for automated testing of just the example test cases. 
            Detailed feedback will be made available when the tests are complete, 
            including processing time, score, and any output from the program. 
            Competitors may submit test examples once every 30 minutes. The competitor's 
            rank and overall score will not be updated.
