        <span class="bodySubtitle">About the Competition</span>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>When to start the Competition Round</strong><br />
                TopCoder members must register for the competition round. Registration may occur at any time
                from.
                <rsc:item name="reg_start_time" row="<%=rsr%>" format="MM.dd.yyyy hh:mm a z"/>
                to
                <rsc:item name="reg_end_time" row="<%=rsr%>" format="MM.dd.yyyy hh:mm a z"/>

                All competitors who have registered for the competition round will immediately be given
                access
                to the competition problem statement for that round. The competition round will begin
                at
                <rsc:item name="coding_start_time" row="<%=rsr%>" format="MM.dd.yyyy hh:mm a z"/>
                which is the
                earliest time that any member will be given
                access to the problem statement.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Upon Entering a Marathon Match</strong><br />
                Each Marathon Match will contain a single problem. The problem statement will indicate both
                the question
                presented to the contestant as well as how submissions will be scored. Contestants will
                submit their
                solution which will immediately be put on a queue for system testing. Once system testing is
                complete,
                the competitor will be assigned a score which will be available on the website. Each
                competitor may
                submit as many times as they choose, however they may only submit once per hour.
            </li>
