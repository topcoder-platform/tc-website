						Ann Arbor--Michigan Engineering sent two sets of EECS students to competitions this past year, and winners came home each time.<BR/><BR/>
						In February, Michigan Engineers were among the winners for the second year in a row at the Student Design Challenge associated with the Design Automation Conference (DAC). In the Operational category, Suhwan Kim and Conrad Ziesler placed first. In the Conceptual category, CoE students won all three awards. Seungbae Lee, Gi-Joon Nam, Junseok Chae, and Hanseup Kim placed first; Li Ding and Yi Li took second; and NamSung Kim, Jiyoun Kim, Mingyu Cho, and Tae-Young Choi finished third.<BR/><BR/>
						The DAC challenge judged the design of integrated circuits or electronic systems developed as part of a student's course or research work at a university or college. Judges evaluated originality, soundness of engineering, measured performance, and the quality of the written submission.<BR/><BR/>
						In July, Jason Dillaman, James Lee, and Andrew Nierman were three of 16 student programmers who qualified through online rounds to compete in the Collegiate Challenge tournament hosted by TopCoder.com in San Francisco, California.<BR/><BR/>
						Dillaman and Lee made it to the semifinal rounds of the Java programming competition, while Nierman advanced to the finals, eventually taking fourth place overall. In the contest, programmers were given various algorithmic problems to solve using Java. Winners were determined by how quickly competitors could accurately solve the problems and how well their solutions stood up against peer scrutiny.<BR/><BR/>
