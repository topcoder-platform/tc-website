<p><strong>GLASTONBURY, CT, June 20, 2005&#151;</strong>TopCoder, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, skills assessment and competitive software development, today announced the return of prize purses to its popular weekly online Single Round Match (SRM) series on a select basis. Eligible TopCoder members can now compete for a share of  $5,000 across multiple divisions inside the renowned TopCoder Arena (<a href="/tc">http://www.topcoder.com/tc</a>). Previously, TopCoder sponsored SRMs awarded more than $860,000 in total prize money. The first group of prize SRMs in more than 2 years will take place on Tuesday June 21, Tuesday July 19 and Monday August 8th. Registration starts at 6:00 p.m. for a 9:00 p.m. match time (all times are Eastern U.S.) See the event schedule on TopCoder's web site for the dates and times of all upcoming SRMs.
<br><br>
"We're excited to be able to offer a return to prize money in our SRMs," said Rob Hughes, President and COO of TopCoder. "It provides another option for sponsors to reach our high caliber membership while giving weekly participants a chance to earn cash, gain recognition amongst the TopCoder community and learn about quality employment opportunities."
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">How to Register for SRMs</span><br>
Contestants can register for matches by visiting the TopCoder Developer Center  (<a href="/tc">http://www.topcoder.com/tc</a>) and downloading the competition arena as an applet or Java Web Start application. Plug-ins are also available for the competition arena. All TopCoder members in good standing, who are at least 13 years of age, may compete in SRM competitions, however contestants must be at least 18 years of age in order to be eligible for cash prizes. In addition to SRMs, TopCoder holds two advancement tournaments (the TopCoder Open and the TopCoder Collegiate Challenge) each year.
