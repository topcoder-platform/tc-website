<span class="bigTitle">Warehouse Management Phase 2 - <br>Ordering, Receiving and Processing</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The Warehouse Management System (WMS) project will significantly increase productivity, cut costs drastically, and provide them with a platform to scale its business to meet increasing demands. 
<br><br>
The Ordering, Receiving, and Processing portion of the application covers the data capture and workflow from purchasing items through receiving and processing the items.  These are the basic pieces: 
<ul>
<li><b>PO Creation</b>: This process will start with a buyer filling out a form that includes information about the goods being purchased and instructions regarding shipping and processing the goods.</li>
<li><b>PO Receiving</b>: Items will have to be counted, audited, and stored in unprocessed inventory when they are received.</li>
<li><b>Processing</b>: This includes many different tasks, including various sorts, grading, and marking. At each sort, information including quantity, status, and sort type is recorded. Sorting includes season, gender, quality, category, and marking.</li>
</ul>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
The Phase 2 Ordering, Receiving, and Processing Assembly Competition will enable our client's business to transfer a majority of their daily functions from paper to computer.  This will allow for on-demand reporting, data integrity, and increased visibility which will ultimately provide a competitive advantage to our client.  
<br><br>
All aspects of the business will be linked through the WMS, which will create a business environment that is more efficient and reliable.  This empowers management to make accurate decisions in dealing with staffing levels and inventory disposition while streamlining their business processes.
