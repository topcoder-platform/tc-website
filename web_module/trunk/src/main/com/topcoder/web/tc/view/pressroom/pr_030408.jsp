<p>
<strong>GLASTONBURY, CONN., March 4, 2008 &#151;</strong>TopCoder&#174;, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, skills assessment and competitive software development, today announced that AOL has signed on to use the company's TopCoder Enterprise Software Development Platform and associated services. The platform's "Software Factory" approach is based upon TopCoder's unique competitive component-based methodology, and will deliver strategic software development capabilities with lowered cost, shorter timelines and higher quality applications. With the TopCoder Enterprise Software Development Platform, AOL will be able to fully harness the skills and on-demand power of TopCoder's virtual collaborative community of 140,000 ranked and rated software developers.
</p>

<p>
"AOL is excited to further leverage the depth and reach of the TopCoder Community through this powerful platform," said Kevin Conroy, executive vice president,, AOL. "We look forward to TopCoder's support as we continue to provide companies, communities and independent developers with new and innovative experiences on the Web and on mobile devices."
</p>

<p>
AOL's use of the TopCoder Enterprise Software Development Platform includes an enterprise-wide license to the TopCoder Component  Catalog of more than 1,100 reusable software components, access to the TopCoder Enterprise Software Development Platform suite of tools and processes and access to the TopCoder Competition engine of online and onsite programming challenges. Over the course of the next 15 months, AOL will leverage the powerful strategic development capabilities presented by this enterprise-wide license to the TopCoder catalog of reusable software components, access the TopCoder "software factory" suite of tools and processes and increase usage of the TopCoder Competition platform of online and onsite programming challenges. In addition, AOL will be afforded unique branding opportunities through enhanced access to the global TopCoder community. During the past 3 years more than $11 million has been paid out to over 1,500 of the top ranked and rated TopCoder designers, developers, architects and assemblers who have competed and contributed to produce the TopCoder Catalog.
</p>

<p>
"The TopCoder software factory approach mitigates many of the challenges associated with managing a full time staff of thousands worldwide by delivering high quality software assets and access to a global pool of developer talent," said Mike Morris, senior vice president of TopCoder, Inc. " Our community combined with an automated assembly line type methodology allows enterprise clients to quickly scale development resources up and down as dictated by their ever changing business requirements."
</p>

<p>
With the TopCoder Component Catalog, AOL will now have direct online access to component documentation, source, build environment and source code. Pre-built and pre-tested TopCoder Components are available 'off the shelf' for rapid development of widgets, web 2.0 applications and enterprise strength mobile products such as AOL's Open Mobile Platform.
