<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The Syndication Framework provides a means to distribute the same content to a variety of web-sites and allow for customized styling of the content (via CSS) as well as multiple levels of access to that content.
<br><br>
The Syndication Framework is composed of a series of components built through the TopCoder Component Production methodology. Additionally, a set of components has been developed to utilize the Syndication Framework for a specific type of syndicated content: Polls. The goal of the Syndicated Polls application is to utilize both the Syndication Framework and a set of APIs designed for delivering Poll content to create a server which will host content that can be displayed and interacted with on third-party websites.
<br><br>
Specific tasks of this application include:
<ul>
<li>Displaying a Poll</li>
<li>Allowing the user to cast a vote for a Poll</li>
<li>Displaying the results of a Poll (numeric, bar graph or pie chart)</li>
</ul>

All code for the application is contained within components. Teams will be responsible for configuration of the components, configuration of the application, conversion of prototype (to content templates) and evaluation/enhancement of components.
<br><br>
These applications are to be used by a TopCoder client. All application documentation (including an assembly guide) will be available once registered. 
<br><br>
NOTE: Please see eligibility requirements below. Competitors must sign a non-disclosure agreement before being admitted into this competition. 
<br><br>
