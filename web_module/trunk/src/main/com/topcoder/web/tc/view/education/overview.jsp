In working with software, odds are you will eventually come face-to-face with an unpleasant fact: sometimes, developers have agendas. While it's certainly not true for everyone, there are developers out there who are looking not just for a paycheck, but for a way to express who they are through code.</li>
<li><A href="/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=features&amp;d2=091806"><strong>Computational geometry with complex numbers</strong></A>, by <tc-webtag:handle coderId="251074" /><br>
Computational geometry problems appear frequently in Topcoder contests and a series of articles has already been written on the subject. However, competitors who have tried to implement these algorithms (particularly in C++) will no doubt have been frustrated&#8230;</li>

Being on the review board, I see designs that are first attempts, those that are well polished and everything in-between. After seeing so many, a few mistakes seem to be made over and over.&#8230;I've attempted to summarize their and my experiences in a compilation of the most 5 common mistakes and how to avoid them.</li>
