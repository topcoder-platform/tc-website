<li><a href="/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=algorithmGames"><strong>Algorithm Games</strong></a>, by <tc-webtag:handle coderId="13396848" context="algorithm"/><br>
In algorithm games, players usually alternate moves until they reach a terminal position -- one player is then declared the winner, and the other the loser. In this tutorial, we'll look at the basic division of positions to winning and losing, along with a look at the Game of Nim and composite games.</li>

Writing code that writes code can be a powerful technique for developers. In an effort to be more productive, developers want to be able to accomplish tasks with fewer keystrokes, bugs, and headaches. While writing a code generator can take longer than simply writing the code, the time you can save in the future will more than make up for the initial effort.</ul>
