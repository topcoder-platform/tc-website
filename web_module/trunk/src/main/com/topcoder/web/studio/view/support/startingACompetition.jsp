                        <h3>How do I post a competition to Studio?</h3>
						<p>
						If you're interested in posting your own competition, you can click on over to TopCoder's new gateway to accessing the community directly, aptly named "[TopCoder Direct]." If you need additional support, or wish to explore our enterprise engagements, please <a href="mailto:studioadmin@topcoder.com">contact us</a>. 
						</p>
						<p>
						
                        <h3>What is TopCoder Direct?</h3>
                        <p>
                        TopCoder Direct is the bridge between you and the TopCoder community. This service allows you to access and utilize the designers within Studio to get all of your creative work done in the most efficient and cost effective way... through competition. You can launch and monitor a project, view and choose winners for your competitions, pay for and download your finished product, all through functional widgets.
                        </p>
						
						<h3>What can I do in this first release?</h3>
                        <p>
                        For this beta release of TopCoder Direct, you can launch image-only design contests (logos, icons, print pieces, web screens) directly into TopCoder Studio. You'll have the ability to create and manage projects and contests, view and evaluate submissions that come in from the members, choose your winners, and download winning files.
                        </p>
                        
						<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
                        <p>
                        Accessing the Direct is completely free. You only pay when you launch a contest. There are two fees associated with launching a contest: the administration fee and the prize amount you are willing to give the first place winner of your contest. The fees vary depending on what type of contest you are launching.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
                        <p>
                        Harnessing the creativity of the Studio community is easy! Just use the "Launch a Project" widget to create your project and then start adding contests. We've provided a simple <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/html/cockpit/landing_page/contestPreparationGuide.html">Contest Preparation Guide</a> to help you get started.
