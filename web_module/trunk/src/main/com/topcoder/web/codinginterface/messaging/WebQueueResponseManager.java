/**
 * This class is used in the case where you want to wait for a response from a JMS Queue.
 * It takes care of waiting for the response to a message for a specified period of time.
 * This would be very straight forward, but we want to solve the case where message A
 * and message B are dispathed in that order, but A takes a long time to come back.  The
 * response to B should be received without waiting for A to come back.
 *
 * When you create an instance of <code>WebQueueResponseManager</code> a thread is created
 * that polls the queue.  When it gets a message, it either puts it into a <code>WebResponsePool</code>
 * or, if the response is old, it is thrown out as it is no longer relevant.
