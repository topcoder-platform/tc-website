                <p><strong>We know you've probably become conditioned to tune out the claims made by other software
                    companies. TopCoder is on a mission to prove
                    that we can develop high-quality software applications differently from those companies. How do we
                    do it?</strong></p>

                <p>We utilize our member base of software developers who are differentiated by talent through
                    competition. Combining this talent with our competition-based methodology and our catalogs of
                    re-usable components is what allows us to develop
                    faster, cheaper, and better.</p>

                    TopCoder's member base is a distributed resource that spans over 150 countries. Unlike strictly
                    off-shore development firms, it doesn't matter what
                    country our members call home, as long as they've proven that they can deliver a better
                    solution than their peers. Since our members work for
                    TopCoder as contractors, not employees, our fixed costs are much lower than our competition.</p>

                    In 2001, we began developing substantial <a href="/catalog/c_showroom.jsp">catalogs</a> of re-usable
                    Java and .NET components. Reusing these bits of
                    software over and over on client projects allows us to substantially shorten timelines and decrease

                    Differentiating our members by talent through competition insures that only quality developers are
                    working on our code. Each week, hundreds of
                    TopCoder members compete in programming <a href="http://www.topcoder.com">competitions,</a> where
                    they are rated based on the results.
                    Only members with acceptable ratings are allowed to develop software for TopCoder.</p>

                <p>Our Component Catalogs are made up of the extremely high quality components developed by our members.
                    These components are of such high
                    quality due to the fact that they have been used and re-used in multiple applications. TopCoder
                    strives to develop as many applications with
                    re-usable components as possible.</p>

                <p><strong>Application Methodology</strong><br>
                    The TopCoder Application Development Methodology is designed to deliver a repeatable and consistent
                    solution to our customers. The TopCoder methodology
                    is comprised of phases and deliverables. The six-step methodology is administered by a TopCoder
                    Project Manager skilled in Component Based Development
                    (CBD) techniques, requirements gathering, and project management.</p>

                <p>During the specification phase, the Project Manager works hand-in-hand with our customers to develop
                    specifications that satisfy all of our customers'
                    requirements. In the component architecture phase, the Project Manager and TopCoder Component
                    Architect identify and design the components required to
                    build the application. Next, the component production phase uses TopCoder's unique
                    <a href="/components/methodology.jsp">component methodology,</a> to create all of the components.
                    During the
                    application assembly phase, the Project Manager hand-selects only proven members to participate in
                    the assembly of the application. The application
                    assemblers must sign a non-disclosure agreement to protect our clients. During this phase, the
                    components are linked together to build the application.
                    Once assembled, the certification phase begins. Prior to deployment at the customer's site, the
                    application is rigorously tested at TopCoder. After
                    certification, the application is delivered to our customers and deployed to their quality assurance
                    environment, as part of the deployment phase. Our
                    rigorous <a href="/applications/methodology.jsp">application methodology,</a> combined with our
                    competition-tested members and our re-usable components, allow TopCoder to deliver applications of
                    the
                    highest quality.</p>
