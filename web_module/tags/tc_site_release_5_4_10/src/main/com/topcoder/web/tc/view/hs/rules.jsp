It will consist of four (4) online Regional elimination rounds and two (2) onsite final rounds, being the Semifinal and Championship Rounds. The top 25 finishers in the online Regional rounds will advance to the onsite Semifinal and Championship rounds, being held on the campus of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, USA on May 19, 2007.
<br><br>
<span class="subtitle">Eligibility</span><br>

TopCoder members who are performing internships for any official tournament sponsor between February 13, 2007 and May 19, 2007 are also ineligible to compete.  
<br><br>
In the event that a competitor is disqualified from any round, no other competitors will be added in his/her place. The only exception to this is advancement to the onsite rounds. 
<br><br>
<span class="subtitle">Registration</span><br>
Registration for the 2007 TopCoder High School Tournament will open at 9:00 AM EST on Monday, February 13, 2007, and will close at 6:00 PM EST on Monday, February 26, 2007.  In order to compete in a Regional Round, competitors must have registered for the tournament prior to 6:00 PM EST on Monday, February 26, 2007.  In order to be eligible to compete in any of the TCHS Tournament, competitors must be a registered TopCoder High School member and have registered separately for the Tournament.  There is no limit to the number of registrants for the tournament; however each individual may only register once.
<br><br>
<span class="subtitle">Online Elimination Rounds</span><br>
All team members and individuals who have competed in at least four (4) rated regional SRMs prior to February 27, 2007 and who have registered for the tournament are eligible to compete in Online Regional Round 1.
<br><br>
Everyone who competes in an online round must register for each round in the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than five (5) minutes prior to the start of the online round.  TopCoder will communicate each Online Regional Round in Eastern Standard Time (UTC/GMT -5) or Eastern Daylight Time (UTC/GMT -4), as appropriate.  <b>Contestants may be located and competing in time zones other than Eastern Standard/Daylight Time and must adjust accordingly.</b>  If a coder does not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition. 
<br><br>
Countries have been assigned to a particular region <A href="/tc?module=Static&d1=hs&d2=regions">here</A>.  Competitors may only compete in the Regional Round for their countryâ€™s region.
<br><br>
All competitors in a Region will be randomly assigned to virtual competition rooms. Rooms will be created such that each room has a maximum of 25 competitors. The number of rooms in each Regional round is maximum # advancers in the round/25.
<br><br>
The dates and times of the online Regional rounds of competition are as follows:

<br><br>
<span class="subtitle">Scoring and Advancing during Online Regional Rounds</span><br>
After each Online Regional Round, the highest scorers from across all rooms in the Region will be identified and will advance to the next online round.  Coder advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round for each coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater-than-zero) point total. The structure of each Online Regional Round is as follows:
<br><br>
<span class="subtitle">Online Regional Round #1</span><br>
<ul>
<li>Up to 200 spots will be open for individuals.  The remaining 800 spots will be open for teams. If there are less than 200 individuals, we will allow more teams to compete until the 1,000 spots are filled or there are no teams left.</li>
<li>Teams will advance until the 1,000 spots have been filled. If the number of available spots left within that 1,000 is not large enough to fully accommodate the next team, the full team will advance.</li>
<li>If there are more than 1,000 qualified participants in any Region prior to Round 1, we will limit it to the top 1,000 teams/individuals in the following manner:
  <ul>
  <li>We will advance the teams with the best average team placement for the four (4) regional rated events in which they placed the best.</li>
  <li>We will advance the individuals with the best average individual placement for the four (4) regional rated events in which they placed the best.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<span class="subtitle">Online Regional Round #2</span><br>
<ul>
<li>Up to 100 spots will be open for individuals. The remaining 400 spots will be open for teams. If there are less than 100 individuals, we will allow more teams to compete until the 500 spots are filled or there are no teams left.</li>
<li>Teams will advance until the 500 spots have been filled. If the number of available spots left within that 500 is not large enough to fully accommodate the next team, the full team will advance.</li>
</ul>
<span class="subtitle">Online Regional Round #3</span><br>
<ul>
<li>Up to 50 spots will be open for individuals.  The remaining 200 spots will be open for teams. If there are less than 50 individuals, we will allow more teams to compete until the 50 spots are filled or there are no teams left.</li>
<li>Teams will advance until the 250 spots have been filled. If the number of available spots left within that 250 is not large enough to fully accommodate the next team, the full team will advance.</li>
</ul>
<span class="subtitle">Online Regional Round #4</span><br>
<ul>
<li>Up to 20 spots will be open for individuals.  The remaining 80 spots will be open for teams.  If there are less than 20 individuals, we will allow more teams to compete until the 20 spots are filled or there are no teams left.</li>
<li>Teams will advance until the 100 spots have been filled. If the number of available spots left within that 100 is not large enough to fully accommodate the next team, the full team will advance.</li>
</ul>
Once a team has been eliminated from the online rounds of competition, members of the team can continue to compete in the individual track provided that their score during the round that their team is eliminated in is sufficient to advance them among the group of competing individuals.
<br><br>
Teams may only travel to the onsite finals with <b>three (3) team members</b>.  The top 6 teams and top 7 individuals from each Online Regional Round #4 (a total of 100 participants) will advance to the onsite finals.  
<br><br>
<b>NOTE:</b>  In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the Online Regional Rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:
<ul>
<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during the previous round of competition.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then by best average team/individual placement at the start of the tournament.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round.</li>
</ul>
<span class="subtitle">Competition Round Structure</span><br>
Each online and onsite round of competition consists of three phases: Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. (Note: The format of these competition rounds is similar to the format of TopCoder High School Single Round Matches.  The rules in place for TCHS Single Round Matches as of February 27, 2007 will also apply to the online and onsite rounds of the TCHS Tournament.)
<ul>
<li><b>The Coding Phase</b> is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened until the time it was submitted.  During the TCHS Tournament, the Coding Phase will last 85 minutes.</li>
<li><b>The Challenge Phase</b> is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.  During the TCHS Tournament, the Challenge Phase will last 10 minutes.</li>
<li><b>The System Testing Phase</b> is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</li>
</ul>

<span class="subtitle">Onsite Semifinal and Championship Rounds</span><br>
The twenty-five (25) advancers from each Online Regional Round #4 will travel to the campus of Purdue University on Friday, May 18, 2007 to compete in the Semifinal round of the TCHS Tournament being held on Saturday, May 19, 2007.  All contestants must arrive at the campus of Purdue University no later than 4:00 PM EDT on Friday, May 18, 2007.  All contestants must confirm their attendance at the onsite rounds no later than 8:00 AM EDT (UTC/GMT -4) on Monday, April 23, 2007.  That is, contestants must have acquired any necessary travel visas and know for certain that they can travel to the U.S. by that date and time.  All three members of a team must be able to travel to the U.S.  If any team member is unable to attend the onsite rounds, the team will forfeit its eligibility to receive any prizes awarded to onsite finalists, and the teamâ€™s spot in the tournament will be given to the eligible next team from Online Round #4.  If an individual is unable to attend the onsite rounds, he/she will forfeit his/her eligibility to receive any prizes awarded to onsite finalists, and his/her spot in the tournament will be given to the next eligible individual from Online Round #4.
<br><br>
At the end of each Online Regional Round #2, TopCoder will issue letters at the request of international competitors who require one to obtain a travel visa to enter the United States.  Visa letters can be requested by emailing MaryBeth Luce at <A href="mailto:mluce@topcoder.com">mluce@topcoder.com</A> and must be requested by Wednesday, April 11, 2007 at 5:00 PM EDT (UTC/GMT -4).  Visas can take a significant amount of time to obtain in certain countries; therefore, for those competitors who need a letter, it is in their best interest to request one well before the deadline.  The cost of obtaining a visa is the sole responsibility of the competitor.
<br><br>
Travel arrangements to Indianapolis, Indiana, USA are the responsibility of each competitor.  TopCoder may assist in making the reservations, but the cost is the responsibility of each competitor.  Each team is <b>required</b> to travel with an adult chaperone (i.e., a person who is 18 years of age or older).  The cost of the chaperoneâ€™s travel arrangements to Indianapolis, Indiana, USA is his/her responsibility.
<br><br>
TopCoder will provide ground transportation from the Indianapolis airport to the Purdue University campus and back to the Indianapolis airport.  TopCoder will also provide campus lodging accommodations on May 18 and 19, 2007 for finalists and chaperones, as well as all meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) for each contestant on May 19, 2007.  All other expenses are the responsibility of the contestant.  
<br><br>
TopCoder will determine the room assignments for the Semifinal rooms prior to the start of the Semifinal Round, in a manner such that people on the same team tend to be placed in different rooms.  The dates and times of the onsite Semifinal and Championship Rounds are as follows:
