                       At NVIDIA we're continually looking for the elite few who will shape the future of the software industry… those who play hard, work smart, and always strive to win. The visual computing industry is ultra-competitive and the stakes are high… to remain a market leader we hire only the brightest and most innovative engineering talent. As a TopCoder member, you've distinguished yourself as a skilled coder who seeks a challenge, and as a competitor in the TCCC05 you've told us that nothing can stop you from competing against the best of the best.</p>
