                        <p>The key to success in driving down the cost of high quality software applications is in the re-use of software components.
                        The most efficient (cost effective) method for component re-use is to utilize components that exist in an environment
                        where multiple organizations share the cost of component development.</p>

                        <p>If a component does not exist within your development environment, the two alternative choices are to buy or to build.
                        Buying components allows your internal software development resources, or external integration partners, to concentrate
                        on the customization necessary to give your company a competitive advantage.</p>

                        <p>Internal resources are typically constrained, while external resources are costly. Purchasing re-usable components
                        improves the productivity of those resources. In addition, the leverage that TopCoder Software gets from marketing
                        components to multiple customers allows those components to be sold for less.</p>

                        <p><span class="normalHead"><strong>Thinking outside the box</strong></span><br />
                        TopCoder Software offers several services in addition to our Component Catalog. These services provide valuable enhancements to
                        our components if you need them:</p>

                        <p><strong>Component Management Services</strong><br />
                        TopCoder employs component development experts as Product Managers. Product Managers are responsible
                        for managing the components developed by the TopCoder Member Base using the TopCoder Component Development
                        Methodology.  Product Managers are available to you to help maximize the value of the Component Catalog.  They
                        will identify component opportunities and specify component requirements.  Their extensive knowledge of the Component Catalog
                        allows them to identify the components that will be of the highest value to you. You already get three days of
                        Component Management Services FREE with a subscription to the Component Catalog. Additional time can be purchased separately.</p>

                        <!-- <p><strong>Component Customization (comment this out)</strong><br />
                        TopCoder Software Components are built with re-usability as the highest priority.  They have been painstakingly developed to
                        encourage extension and customization.  Generic TopCoder components will often be extended and customized to meet a specific
                        customerï¿½s needs.  TopCoder is available to extend and customize catalog components for individual customers. -->

                        <p><strong>Component Integration</strong><br />
                        TopCoder is constantly integrating components into both internal applications and more complex components for the Component
                        Catalog.  In cases where you need help integrating TopCoder Components into your organization, TopCoder Software Integration
                        Teams are available to help.</p>

                        <p><strong>Productivity Tools</strong><br />
                        TopCoder Software is developing productivity tools to help improve the development process. The first tool is the TopCoder Rules
                        Engine. The Rules Engine centralizes and manages business logic for use in multiple applications. The Rules Engine is available
                        for purchase separately from the component catalog.</p>
