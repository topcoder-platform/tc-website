<b>Registration</b><br>
Registration for the 2006 TopCoder Open Sponsor Track Competition will open 9:00AM EST on Monday, February 13, 2006, and will close at 9:00AM EST on Tuesday, February 28, 2006.  In order to be eligible to compete in the Sponsor Track Competition, competitors must be a registered TopCoder member and must register separately for the Sponsor Track Competition.  There is no limit to the number of registrants in the competition, however each individual may only register once.
<br><br>

<a href="#top"><img src="/i/interface/back_to_top_dk.gif" alt="back to top" width="83" height="23" border="0" align="right"></a>
<b>Qualification Round &mdash; Noon EST Tuesday, February 28 through Noon EST Wednesday, March 1, 2006</b><br>
The Qualification Round will be open for 24 hours from Noon EST Tuesday, February 28 through Noon EST Wednesday, March 1, 2006.  Each competitor may participate in the Qualification Round at any time during the 24 hours.  Competitors may only attempt to qualify one time using one account during the 24 hours.
<br><br>
The Qualification Round will consist of only two phases: the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase. <br> Note: The Qualification Round will not include a Challenge Phase.
<ul>
<li>The Qualification Round Coding Phase is a timed event where contestants are randomly presented with one of five possible problem sets.  Each problem set contains two questions representing two levels of complexity and, accordingly, two levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.  Competitors will have 60 minutes to complete either or both of the problems.  The 60 minutes will begin to elapse once the first problem is opened.  The timer in the coding window will count down to the end of the 60 minutes.  A competitor who begins the qualification attempt within the final 60 minutes of the Qualification Round will have less than 60 minutes to attempt qualification.</li>
<li>The Qualification Round System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code at the conclusion of the Qualification Round. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given question. </li>
</ul>

Upon logging in to the TopCoder Arena during the Qualification Round, each competitor who has registered for the Sponsor Track Competition will receive a message indicating which set of problems he/she has been assigned.  The highest 20 positive (i.e., greater than zero) scorers from each of the five problem sets presented during the Qualification Round will be eligible to compete in Online Round #1 of the Sponsor Track Competition.  A maximum of 100 competitors will advance to Online Round #1.  Members will be rated at the conclusion of the Qualification Round based on their performance against others presented with the same problem set.  
<br><br>
<b>NOTE:</b>  In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the Qualification Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:
<ul>
<li>By rating (higher is better) prior to the Qualification Round.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<a name="structure"></a>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Online Elimination Rounds</span>
<br><br>
Everyone who competes in an online round must login to the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than five (5) minutes prior to the start of the online round. Sponsor employees and interns from around the world may be participating in the online rounds, but all start times will be communicated as Eastern Standard Time (GMT -5), so contestants in different time zones must adjust accordingly. If a coder does not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition. 
<br><br>

All Sponsor Track competitors who have qualified for an online round will be assigned to one specific room for each round of the competition.
<br><br>

The dates and times of the online rounds of competition are as follows:

<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Scoring and Advancing during Online Rounds</span>
<br><br>

After each round of competition, the highest scorers from across the room will be identified and will advance to the next online round. Coder advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round for each coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater-than-zero) point total. The structure of the online rounds is as follows:
<br><br>

<b>Online Round #1</b><br>
Up to 100 coders will compete in Round #1 and up to 50 will advance.  The highest 50 scorers from the room will advance to Online Round #2.  
<br><br>

<b>Online Round #2</b><br>
Up to 50 coders will compete and up to 25 will advance.  The highest 25 scorers from the room will advance to Online Round #3.  
<br><br>

<b>Online Round #3</b><br>
Up to 25 coders will compete and up to 10 will advance.  The highest 10 scorers from the room will advance to Online Round #4.  
<br><br>

<b>Final Online Round</b><br>
This round will be the last round of the Sponsor Track Competition.  Up to 10 coders will compete and the coder who finishes with the highest score will be the winner of the Sponsor Track Competition.  
<br><br>

<b>NOTE:</b>  In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the online rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:
<ul>
<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during the previous online rounds of the tournament (excluding the Qualification Round).</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then by rating (higher is better) following the Qualification Round.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Round Structure</span>
<br><br>

With the exception of the Qualification Round, each online and onsite round of competition consists of three phases: the Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. (Note: The format of these competition rounds is similar to the format of TopCoder Single Round Matches.  The rules in place for the Single Round Matches as of February 28, 2006 will also apply to the online rounds of the Sponsor Track Competition.)
<br><br>

<ul>
<li>The Coding Phase is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened until the time it was submitted.  The Coding Phase will last 75 minutes.  </li>
<li>The Challenge Phase is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.  The Challenge Phase will last 15 minutes.  </li>
<li>The System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem.  No test cases from the Challenge Phase of the Sponsor Track Competition will be added to the test cases used for the System Testing Phase of the Sponsor Track Competition.</li>
</ul>
