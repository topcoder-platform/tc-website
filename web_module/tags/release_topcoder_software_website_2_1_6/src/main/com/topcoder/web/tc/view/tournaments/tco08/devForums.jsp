            The Client Cockpit application will provide TopCoder customers the ability to directly engage the TopCoder membership to build software applications without the direct assistance of TopCoder staff. It is the first step in a new evolution of TopCoder which will bring vast new opportunities for communication, collaboration and compensation to the community.</p>
            <p>The interface consists of a framework into which various widgets with differing functionality are embedded, customized by the user according to his/her needs and interests. Through the cockpit, the customer will have to ability to create projects and manage them every step of the way, from launching competitions to making payment and taking delivery.</p>
            <p>The presentation will include an overview of the cockpit process.  Particular attention will be paid to opportunities for members to act as TopCoder "co-pilots" or even Project Managers assisting clients directly in their ability to execute projects and competitions.</p>
            <p>The Widget Innerworkings workshop will cover the widget framework innerworkings and describe all of the currently available and planned services.  Use this workshop to build your own widget, or write up the specifications for a new widget and/or service for TopCoder to build for you.  There will be opportunities for members to sign up as Project Managers or Architects for specific widgets and/or services.</p>
            
            <h4>3:00 PM - 3:45 PM</h4>

            <h4>4:00 PM - 4:45 PM</h4>
            <p><strong>Quality Through Review with Sean Campion, Project Manager, TopCoder, Inc.</strong><br />
            Code reviews have long been recognized as an effective means to build quality software, but suffers from perennial staff and time shortages.  At TopCoder, our built-in review mechanism ensures reviews are conducted not only at the code development level, but throughout all stages of the SDLC.  This ubiquitous open-review process allows TopCoder to build the highest-quality components.  This discussion will walk you through the review mechanism and metrics.</p>
