						Erin native wins $100,000 in contest<BR/>
						By MARGARET COSTELLO<BR/>

						When it comes to computer programming, Erin native Jason Woolever is tops. The 22-year-old placed first among 16 finalists in a three-day computer programming competition in San Francisco. The victory earned him $100,000.<BR/><BR/>
						"He won, but I'm the one who's shaken," said his mother, Beverly Woolever of Erin. "I just can't believe it."<BR/><BR/>
						Jason Woolever qualified for the semifinals after competing in preliminary rounds on TopCoder Inc.'s Web site. The company is committed to identifying and promoting top-notch computer programming. It uses competitions to attract and rate highly skilled programmers.<BR/><BR/>
						He traveled to San Francisco for the championship rounds earlier this week.<BR/><BR/>
						Woolever beat three competitors Wednesday during semifinals. He received $25,000 and a chance to play in the championship round Thursday.<BR/><BR/>
						Woolever said he was a little nervous going into the final round because he knew the other programmers were strong contenders. "I didn't work as quickly as I did during the semifinal round," Woolever said Thursday evening from his hotel room in San Francisco.<BR/><BR/>
						He finished just a few minutes ahead of the next-fastest competitor. A complex scoring system ranked him third after completing the programming section. However, each competitor then had the chance to challenge others' programs for accuracy and efficiency.<BR/><BR/>
						After testing, Woolever's solutions to the three problems proved to be the best.<BR/><BR/>
						"I was like, 'Wow,' " Woolever said. "This is the first time that I've won something with so much money attached."<BR/><BR/>
						Woolever said he might use the winnings for a down payment on a house in the Silicon Valley area, where he begins work on Monday.<BR/><BR/>
						To compete in the national contest, Jason Woolever had to miss his graduation ceremony at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., where he earned his master's in engineering.<BR/><BR/>
						Woolever said he intends to compete in TopCoder's next competition in Las Vegas this fall against collegiate and professional computer programmers.<BR/><BR/>
						"We'll see how I can fare in that," Woolever said.<BR/><BR/>
						His parents, Beverly and Richard Woolever, said they hope at least some of his winnings will go toward a plane ticket home for Christmas.<BR/><BR/>
						They won't have a chance to see him before he starts his job as a senior research and development engineer at the Synopsys in Sunnyvale, Calif., which creates software tools for computer chip designs.<BR/><BR/>
						"We just keep shaking our heads," Beverly Woolever said. "It's been amazing for us. But Jason is the same ole Jason. He just does the best he can. Win or lose."<BR/><BR/>
