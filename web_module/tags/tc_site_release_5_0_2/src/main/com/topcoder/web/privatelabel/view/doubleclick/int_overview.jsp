         <p class="pageTitle">Announcing the DoubleClick 2004 Coding Challenge!</p>

         <p>It's bigger and better than before!  For this year's tournament, we have teamed up with TopCoder - the leader in online programming competitions - to bring you an exciting contest with two online rounds and fantastic prizes for the 10 best performers.</p>

         <p>For those who make it to the finals, the bounty is great: prizes, recognition among co-workers and the satisfaction of having beaten DoubleClick employees from around the world.  As an added twist to the 2004 Coding Challenge, you'll have the chance to check your skills against some of New York City's brightest minds.  While you won't be competing for the same prizes, you will be asked to solve the same problems as participants from Columbia and NYU.</p>

         <p>The DoubleClick 2004 Coding Challenge, Powered by TopCoder&#174;, is your chance to prove you are the best!  Are you up to the challenge?</p>

         <p><span class="dc_subTitle">What language do you speak?</span><br/>
         Participants will have their choice of using Java, C++, C# or VB.Net - the most relevant of current software development technologies - to solve complex algorithmic problems. </p>

         <p><span class="dc_subTitle">Here's what you do</span><br/>
         Download the DoubleClick 2004 Coding Challenge Qualification Round <a class="bodyText_link" href="/i/events/doubleclick/int_competitionManual.pdf" target="_blank">Competition Manual</a>.</p>

         <p>The tournament is a timed contest where all participants compete online to solve the same problems under the same time constraints.  Here's how it works:</p>

         <ul>
         <li><span class="dc_subTitle">Download the Arena</span><br/>
         The TopCoder&#174; Competition Arena (a Java Applet) is where the action takes place. Download the applet, read the problem statements, then code solutions, compile and test those solutions and submit your code for points. To get acquainted with the environment, you can download the arena to work on sample problems prior to the competition. </li>

         <li><span class="dc_subTitle">Coding Phase</span><br/>
         At the designated date and time, competitors enter the Arena and are placed in groups of ten into virtual rooms. All participants are presented with the same set of three problems of escalating difficulty. Beat your co-workers by creating an accurate solution in the shortest amount of time. A leader board will track the points along the way. </li>

         <li><span class="dc_subTitle">Challenge Phase</span><br/>
         The Challenge Phase allows competitors to view each other's code and try to "break'" that code. You challenge another competitor's code by passing test cases against it, with the hope that you can make it fail. Breaking another developer's code is the most direct form of competition for a programmer. In this phase, precious points are awarded or taken away based on the success of the challenges.</li>

         <li><span class="dc_subTitle">System Tests</span><br/>
         Within minutes of the end of the Challenge Phase, TopCoder's automated, objective system tests determine the accuracy of all submissions and award final points to all competitors. The assessment of your performance and presentation of stats is nearly instantaneous, as is the gratification of knowing how you did against this competitive field.</li>
         </ul>

         <p><span class="dc_subTitle">Ready to prove you're one of DoubleClick's best?</span><br/>
         Registration for the DoubleClick 2004 Coding Challenge opens on February 2nd and closes on February 15th.  All employees who register will be eligible to compete in the Main Competition Round.</p>

         <p>The top 10 scorers from the Main Competition Round will be invited to compete for great prizes in the Final Round being held online on February 27th.</p>

         <p><span class="dc_subTitle">Prizes</span><br/>
         All participants in the Main Competition Round will receive a "DoubleClick 2004 Coding Challenge" T-shirt.  The participants in the Final Round will receive the following prizes:</p>
