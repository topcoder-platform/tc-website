            <br clear="all">

<p>A previous series of <a href="tc?module=Static&amp;d1=tutorials&amp;d2=geometry1">articles</a>
        covered the basic tools of computational geometry. In this
        article I'll explore some more advanced algorithms that can
        be built from these basic tools. They are all based on the
        simple but powerful idea of a sweep line: a vertical line that is
        conceptually &ldquo;swept&rdquo; across the plane. In
        practice, of course, we cannot simulate all points in time and
        so we consider only some discrete points.</p>

        <p>In several places I'll refer to the Euclidean and Manhattan
        distances. The Euclidean distance is the normal, everyday distance
        given by Pythagoras' Theorem. The Manhattan distance between
        points (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>,
        y<sub>2</sub>) is the distance that must be travelled while
        moving only horizontally or vertically, namely 
        |x<sub>1</sub> &minus; x<sub>2</sub>| + |y<sub>1</sub> &minus;
        y<sub>2</sub>|. It is called the Manhattan distance because
        the roads in Manhattan are laid out in a grid and so
        the Manhattan distance is the distance that must be travelled
        by road (it is also called the &quot;taxicab distance,&quot; or more
        formally the L<sub>1</sub> metric).</p>

        <p>In addition, a <a href="/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=tutorials&amp;d2=binarySearchRedBlack">balanced
            binary tree</a> is used in some of the
        algorithms. Generally you can just use a <code>set</code>
        in C++ or a <code>TreeSet</code> in Java, but in some cases
        this is insufficient because it is necessary to store extra
        information in the internal nodes.</p>

        <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Closest pair</span><br />
        Given a set of points, find the pair that is closest
        (with either metric). Of course, this can be solved in
        O(N<sup>2</sup>) time by considering all the pairs, but a line
        sweep can reduce this to O(N&nbsp;log&nbsp;N).</p>

        <p>Suppose that we have processed points 1 to
        N&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 (ordered by X) and the shortest distance
        we have found so far is h. We now process point N and try to
        find a point closer to it than h. We maintain a set of all
        already-processed points whose X coordinates are within h of
        point N, as shown in the light grey rectangle. As each point
        is processed, it is added to the set, and when we move on to
        the next point or when h is decreased, points are removed from
        the set. The set is ordered by y coordinate. A balanced binary
        tree is suitable for this, and accounts for the log N
        factor.</p>

        <div align="center"><img src="/i/education/lineSweep/closest.png" alt="Closest points" border="0" style="margin-top: 10px 10px 0px 10px;" /></a></div>

        <p>To search for points closer than h to point N, we need only
        consider points in the active set, and furthermore we need
        only consider points whose y coordinates are in the range
        y<sub>N</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;h to y<sub>N</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;h
        (those in the dark grey rectangle). This range can be
        extracted from the sorted set in O(log N) time, but more
        importantly the number of elements is O(1) (the exact maximum
        will depend on the metric used), because the separation
        between any two points in the set is at least h. It follows
        that the search for each point requires O(log N) time, giving
        a total of O(N&nbsp;log&nbsp;N).</p>

        <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Line segment intersections</span><br />
        We'll start by considering the problem of returning all
        intersections in a set of horizontal and vertical line
        segments. Since horizontal lines don't have a single X
        coordinate, we have to abandon the idea of sorting objects by
        X. Instead, we have the idea of an <dfn>event</dfn>: an X
        coordinate at which something interesting happens. In this
        case, the three types of events are: start of a horizontal line,
        end of a horizontal line, and a vertical line. As the sweep line
        moves, we'll keep an <dfn>active set</dfn> of horizontal
        lines cut by the sweep line, sorted by Y value (the red lines
        in the figure).</p>

        <div align="center"><img src="/i/education/lineSweep/linesvh.png" alt="Intersections of horizontal and vertical lines" border="0" style="margin-top: 10px 10px 0px 10px;" /></a></div>

        <p>To handle either of the horizontal line events, we simply
        need to add or remove an element from the set. Again, we can
        use a balanced binary tree to guarantee O(log N) time for
        these operations. When we hit a vertical line, a range search
        immediately gives all the horizontal lines that it cuts. If
        horizontal or vertical segments can overlap there is some
        extra work required, and we must also consider whether lines
        with coincident endpoints are considered to intersect, but
        none of this affects the computational complexity.</p>

        <p>If the intersections themselves are required, this takes
        O(N&nbsp;log&nbsp;N + I) time for I intersections. By augmenting the
        binary tree structure (specifically, by storing the size
        of each sub-tree in the root of that sub-tree), it is possible
        to count the intersections in O(N&nbsp;log&nbsp;N) time.</p>

        <p>In the more general case, lines need not be horizontal or
        vertical, so lines in the
        active set can exchange places when they intersect. Instead of
        having all the events pre-sorted, we have to use a priority
        queue and dynamically add and remove intersection events. At
        any point in time, the priority queue contains events for the
        end-points of line-segments, but also for the intersection
        points of <em>adjacent</em> elements of the active set
        (providing they are in the future). Since there are O(N + I)
        events that will be reached, and each requires O(log N) time
        to update the active set and the priority queue, this
        algorithm takes O(N&nbsp;log&nbsp;N + I log N) time. The figure below
        shows the future events in the priority queue (blue dots);
        note that <em>not</em> all future intersections are in the
        queue, either because one of the lines isn't yet active, or
        because the two lines are not yet adjacent in the active list.</p>

        <div align="center"><img src="/i/education/lineSweep/lines.png" alt="Intersections of lines" border="0" style="margin-top: 10px 10px 0px 10px;" /></a></div>

        <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Area of the union of rectangles</span><br />
        Given a set of axis-aligned rectangles, what is the area of
        their union? Like the line-intersection problem, we can handle
        this by dealing with events and active sets. Each rectangle
        has two events: left edge and right edge. When we cross the
        left edge, the rectangle is added to the active set. When we
        cross the right edge, it is removed from the active set.</p>

        <div align="center"><img src="/i/education/lineSweep/rects.png" alt="Union of rectangles" border="0" style="margin-top: 10px 10px 0px 10px;" /></a></div>

        <p>We now know which rectangles are cut by the sweep line (red
        in the diagram), but we actually want to know the length of
        sweep line that is cut (the total length of the solid blue
        segments). Multiplying this length by the horizontal distance
        between events gives the area swept out between those two
        events.</p>

        <p>We can determine the cut length by running the same
        algorithm in an inner loop, but rotated 90 degrees. Ignore the
        inactive rectangles, and consider a horizontal sweep line that
        moves top-down. The events are now the horizontal edges of the
        active rectangles, and every time we cross one, we can simply
        increment or decrement a counter that says how many rectangles
        overlap at the current point. The cut length increases as long
        as the counter is non-zero. Of course, we do not increase it
        continuously, but rather while moving from one event to the
        next.</p>

        <p>With the right data structures, this can be implemented in
        O(N<sup>2</sup>) time (hint: use a boolean array to store the
        active set rather than a balanced binary tree, and pre-sort
        the entire set of horizontal edges). In fact the
        inner line sweep can be replaced by some clever binary tree
        manipulation to reduce the overall time to O(N&nbsp;log&nbsp;N), but
        that is more a problem in data structures than in
        geometry, and is left as an exercise for the reader. The
        algorithm can also be adapted to answer similar questions,
        such as the total perimeter length of the union or the maximum
        number of rectangles that overlap at any point.</p>

        <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Convex hull</span><br />
        The <dfn>convex hull</dfn> of a set of points is the
        smallest convex polygon that surrounds the entire set, and has
        a number of practical applications. An efficient method that
        is often used in contests is the Graham scan [2], which
        requires a sort by angle. This isn't as easy as it looks at
        first, since computing the actual angles is expensive and
        introduces problems with numeric error. A simpler yet equally
        efficient algorithm is due to Andrew [1], and requires only a
        sort by X for a line sweep (although Andrew's original paper
        sorts by Y and has a few optimizations I won't discuss here).</p>

        <p>Andrew's algorithm splits the convex hull into two parts,
        the upper and lower hull. Usually these meet at the ends, but
        if more than one points has minimal (or maximal) X coordinate,
        then they are joined by a vertical line segment. We'll
        describe just how to construct the upper hull; the lower hull
        can be constructed in similar fashion, and in fact can be
        built in the same loop.</p>

        <p>To build the upper hull, we start with the point with
        minimal X coordinate, breaking ties by taking the largest Y
        coordinate. After this, points are added in order of X
        coordinate (always taking the largest Y value when multiple
        points have the same X value). Of course, sometimes this will
        cause the hull to become concave instead of convex:</p>

        <div align="center"><img src="/i/education/lineSweep/uhull.png" alt="Upper hull" border="0" style="margin-top: 10px 10px 0px 10px;" /></a></div>

        <p>The black path shows the current hull. After adding point
        7, we check whether the last triangle (5, 6, 7) is convex. In
        this case it isn't, so we delete the second-last point, namely
        6. The process is repeated until a convex triangle is found.
        In this case we also examine (4, 5, 7) and delete 5 before
        examining (1, 4, 7) and finding that it is convex, before
        proceeding to the next point. This is essentially the same
        procedure that is used in the Graham scan, but proceeding in
        order of X coordinate rather than in order of the angle made
        with the starting point. It may at first appear that this
        process is O(N<sup>2</sup>) because of the inner backtracking
        loop, but since no point can be deleted more than once it is
        in fact O(N). The algorithm over-all is O(N&nbsp;log&nbsp;N), because
        the points must initially be sorted by X coordinate.</p>

        <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Manhattan minimum spanning tree</span><br />
        We can create even more powerful algorithms by combining a
        line sweep with a divide-and-conquer algorithm. One example is
        computing the minimum spanning tree of a set of points, where
        the distance between any pair of points is the Manhattan
        distance. This is essentially the algorithm presented by
        Guibas and Stolfi [3].</p>

        <p>We first break this down into a simpler problem.  Standard
        MST algorithms for general graphs (e.g., Prim's algorithm) can
        compute the MST in O((E + N) log N) time for E edges. If we
        can exploit geometric properties to reduce the number of edges
        to O(N), then this is merely O(N&nbsp;log N). In fact we can
        consider, for each point P, only its nearest neighbors in
        each of the 8 octants of the plane (see the figure below). The
        figure shows the situation in just one of the octants, the
        West-Northwest one. Q is the closest neighbour (with the
        dashed line indicating points at the same Manhattan distance
        as Q), and R is some other point in the octant. If PR is an
        edge in a spanning tree, then it can be removed and replaced
        by either PQ or QR to produce a better spanning tree, because
        the shape of the octant guarantees that |QR| &le; |PR|. Thus,
        we do not need to consider PR when building the spanning
        tree.</p>

        <div align="center"><img src="/i/education/lineSweep/octants.png" alt="Octants" border="0" style="margin-top: 10px 10px 0px 10px;" /></a></div>

        <p>This reduces the problem to that of finding the nearest
        neighbour in each octant. We'll just consider the octant
        shown; the others are no different and can be handled by
        symmetry. It should be clear that within this octant, finding
        the nearest neighbour is equivalent to just finding the point
        with the largest value of x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;y, subject to an
        upper bound on x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y and a lower bound on y, and
        this is the form in which we'll consider the problem.</p>

        <p>Now imagine for the moment that the lower bound on y did
        not exist. In this case we could solve the problem for every P
        quite easily: sweep through the points in increasing order of
        x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y, and Q will be the point with the largest
        x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;y value of those seen so far. This is
        where the divide-and-conquer principle comes into play: we
        partition the point set into two halves with a horizontal
        line, and recursively solve the problem for each half. For
        points P in the upper half, nothing further needs to be done,
        because points in the bottom half cannot play Q to their P.
        For the bottom half, we have to consider that by ignoring the
        upper half so far we may have missed some closer points.
        However, we can take these points into account in a similar
        manner as before: walk through all the points in
        x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y order, keeping track of the best point in the
        top half (largest x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;y value), and for each
        point in the bottom half, checking whether this best top-half
        point is better than the current neighbour.</p>

        <p>So far I have blithely assumed that any set of points can
        be efficiently partitioned on Y and also walked in
        x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y order without saying how this should be done.
        In fact, one of the most beautiful aspects of this class of
        divide-and-conquer plus line-sweep algorithms is that it has
        essentially the same structure as a merge sort, to the point
        that a merge-sort by x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y can be folded into the
        algorithm in such a way that each subset is sorted on
        x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y just when this is needed (the points initially
        all being sorted on Y). This gives the algorithm a running
        time of O(N&nbsp;log&nbsp;N).</p>

        <p>The idea of finding the closest point within an angle range
        can also be used to solve the Euclidean MST problem, but the
        O(N&nbsp;log&nbsp;N) running time is no longer guaranteed in the worst
        cases, because the distance is no longer a linear equation.
        It is actually possible to compute the Euclidean MST in
        O(N&nbsp;log&nbsp;N) time, because it is a subset of the Delaunay
        triangulation.</p>

            connected set can be computed from scratch for each
            event.</dd>

            <dd>The events of interest are the vertices of the two
            polygons, and the intersection points of their edges.
            Between consecutive events, the section cut by the sweep line
            varies linearly. Thus, we can sample the cut area at the
            mid-point X value of each of these regions to get the
            average for the whole region. Sampling at these mid-points
            also eliminates a lot of special-case handling, because the
            sweep line is guaranteed not to pass anywhere near a
            vertex. Unlike the solution proposed in the <a href="/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=match_editorials&amp;d2=srm250">match
                editorial</a>, the only geometric tool required is
            line-line intersection.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Conclusion</span><br />
        Like dynamic programming, the sweep line is an extremely
        powerful tool in an algorithm competitor's toolkit because it
        is not simply an algorithm: it is an algorithm pattern that
        can be tailored to solve a wide variety of problems, including
        other textbooks problems that I have not discussed here
        (Delaunay triangulations, for example), but also novel
        problems that may have been created specifically for a
        contest. In TopCoder the small constraints often mean that one
        can take shortcuts (such as processing each event from scratch
        rather than incrementally, and in arbitrary order), but the
        concept of the sweep line is still useful in finding a
        solution.</p>
