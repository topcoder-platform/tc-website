<p>TCO COMPONENT DESIGN FINALS</p>

<p>An elegant and competent design netted Pops victory today in TopCoder
Software's first software design tournament. In a long competition that
ended in an intense onsite finish, his design narrowly edged out a
capable design from kyky in the eyes of three reviewers (Ken_Vogel,
valeriy and myself, srowen), by a score of 92.24 to 86.65.</p>

<p>Pops (Tim Roberts) will return home to North Carolina tomorrow with
first prize and a $10,000 check. Asked where the money would go, he
just said "the kids." Pops praised the competition: "It's nice to be
able to measure yourself against other people." kyky (Sergey
Kalinichenko), of California, takes away a cool $5,000, though he
expressed disappointment with the outcome, feeling that some of his
submission's strengths had been overlooked. "It's not good how the
review process looks for specific things," said kyky. But he says it's
a good first event and is having fun.</p>


<p>THE ROAD TO THE FINALS</p>

<p>The road to this day was long. Pops and kyky navigated through three
online tournament rounds, submitting seven designs between the two of
them -- about 100 hours of software design work in total. Pops entered
the final round as the #1 seed, and the favorite to win, with a score
of 93.92 out of 100 in round 2; kyky followed as the #2 seed with a
score of 81.42.</p>

<p>The reviewers -- myself, Ken_Vogel and valeriy -- received and reviewed
submissions about two weeks before the onsite event. Aware of the
amount of money riding on this competition, we considered and
re-considered both designs' proposed approach, and scrutinized the
supporting documentation. This was necessary, as both designs were
well-considered and carefully documented, and it was difficult to find
fault with either one.</p>


<p>THE BATTLEGROUND: ASPECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING FACTORY</p>

<p>Both competitors submitted a complete Java design for the Aspect-Oriented
Programming Factory component, including class, use case and
sequence diagrams in UML, and a written component specification.
Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is an intriguing programming paradigm
that tries to cleanly encapsulate cross-cutting "aspects" a software
program (e.g. logging, monitoring), which are typically difficult to
encapsulate cleanly in object-oriented languages like Java. This
component may be considered an "AOP lite" package for Java which
provides basic AOP-like functionality.</p>

<p>In short, this component can decorate Java objects with aspects --
actions that are triggered whenever a method of that object is called.
For example, one might add a logging aspect to an object that would log
information about every method called on that object.</p>

<p>There are two basic approaches to this component, one basic on dynamicv
proxy classes (see java.lang.reflect.Proxy), and another that
constructs byte code at runtime.</p>

<p>One can use the Proxy class to create objects that intercept and act on
method calls to another given object. This is simple and flexible, but
by Proxy's nature, this approach can only act on calls to public
methods that are defined in an interface which the underlying object
implements.</p>

<p>The other approach is significantly more complex and possibly
problematic -- at runtime, create and load the byte code for a new
"decorator" class for a given class, one which invokes aspects and also
calls the original object's method. This approach is somewhat more
powerful, as it could act on any public instance method.</p>


<p>AN ANALYSIS OF THE SUBMISSIONS</p>

<p>The requirements for this component are, in brief:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support adding aspects to objects</li>
<li>Support multiple aspects per object</li>
<li>Support user-defined aspects</li>
<li>Design a logging aspect (using TCS's Logging component)</li>
<li>Design a timer aspect (using TCS's Timer component)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, competitors were given enough freedom to pursue either approach.
Both designs focused on the Proxy-based approach, however. It was clear
from prior discussions in the component forums that both competitors
had a good grasp of the component requirements and how to satisfy them.
So, this competition was won on quality of execution.</p>

<p>In my view, Pops's design was satisfyingly straightforward. It
consistently used object-oriented design principles sensibly. The
documentation was superb. Ken_Vogel noted that the clean design served
him well in the final round -- the required new functionality fit
naturally into his work. kyky's design had a bit more functionality;
for example, it supported adding aspects at the class level instead of
instance level. The UML diagrams were easy to parse visually, and it
also gave attention to performance optimizations.</p>

<p>Both were fine submissions, and the scores reflected this. valeriy did
have a specific comment about the design choices: he did not like the
decision to make aspect objects mutable, in both designs, but did like
them overall. Ken_Vogel said that either of these submissions would win
in a usual TopCoder component project; both are of the quality that he
typically sees in winning designs.</p>


<p>ON-SITE: APPEALS, A NEW REQUIREMENT, FINAL REVIEW</p>

<p>The competition climaxed this morning in the on-site phase of this
final round. 8:00 a.m. in the tournament room found both competitors
settled into the competition booths, with access to reviews of their
submissions for the first time. And, both had until 12:00 noon to
appeal comments in the reviews in a live chat with all three reviewers,
and also complete design changes to support a new design requirement.</p>

<p>kyky came into the final round with an initial score of 86.87 on his
submission, behind Pops's score of 92.63 -- pretty close.</p>

<p>By 8:30 a.m. the chat room was busy. Both competitors defended their
submissions against almost every review item. "Everyone was looking for
points of course," said project manager Marc Grzeskowiak, commenting on
the level of competitiveness. Competitors and reviewers resolved all
issues promptly, though that didn't stop Pops and Ken_Vogel from
arguing one point for the better part of an hour, after the portion
relevant to the contest had been settled -- that's intensity!</p>

<p>By 10:30 a.m. the chat fell silent. Both competitors had apparently
finished dealing with review items and had turned to the new
requirement:</p>

<p>* Query the component for a list of all decorated objects, and query
those objects' given aspects.</p>

<p>Both were under pressure to fit this new functionality cleanly into a
carefully constructed design. Again, the new functionality was
straightforward, and this was a matter of producing a good design and
documentation under unusual time pressure. In this close contest, a
slightly cleaner design, or slightly clearer documentation could be the
difference between first and second place.</p>

<p>Just before 12:00 noon, both competitors submitted their final work and
stepped away from the computers. Both submitted similar changes to
their designs, and were admirable efforts. The reviewers spent the next
three hours re-reviewing the two submissions and adjusting scores. kyky
closed the score gap slightly with excellent work on the new
requirement, but Pops's lead was too large to overcome in this final
round and the reviewers unanimously named him the winner.</p>

<p>Congratulations are due to both worthy competitors!</p>

<p>TCO COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT FINALS</p>

<p>Today, rnielsen came out on top in the first TopCoder Software software
development tournament, in what proved to be a treacherous contest. His
development solution scored 88.70 in the final onsite round, besting a
competing submission from aksonov, which scored 66.06 due to a single,
surprising issue.</p>

<p>rnielsen (Rob Nielsen) gets the thrill of victory and $10,000 to keep
him company on the long trip back to Australia. "It's a good contest"
he said. Regarding his performance on-site today, rnielsen said that
his submission was in pretty good shape coming into the contest. "If I
had had bigger problems, it would have been much harder." And aksonov
(Pavlo Aksonov) will return to the Ukraine with a $5,000 check and
congratulations on a job well done. "I am disappointed ... not sure
what happened with my submission, but it was hanging," says aksonov,
"but this is a great, exciting event."</p>


<p>THE ROAD TO THE FINALS</p>

<p>aksonov and rnielsen arrived here after persevering through months of
competition in the preceding rounds -- each submitted five development
submissions before today. Impressively, aksonov placed first in the
second round of *both* the design and development tournaments. Per
contest rules, he advanced to compete in the development finals,
emerging as the slight favorite in the finals with a second round score
of 95.68. rnielsen however was close behind after the second round with
a score of 93.89.</p>

<p>BryanChen, lkw and mishagam reviewed the submissions and began
preparing test cases almost two weeks in advance of today's final
round. This was a challenging component to test, given its distributed
nature and the complexity of the design, said mishagam.</p>


<p>THE BATTLEGROUND: DISTRIBUTED SIMPLE CACHE</p>

<p>Both competitors implemented the design for the Distributed Simple
Cache component. This is an ambitious design that extends TopCoder's
Simple Cache component across multiple servers, and keeps them
synchronized. Its structure and protocol are undeniably complex,
accounting for multiple servers, failures, and so on. aksonov and
rnielsen submitted source code, unit tests, and supporting
documentation for their development solution.</p>

<p>There was an additional challenge here: Distributed Simple Cache's
designer was unavailable during the development of this component. I
was asked to step in and moderate the design discussions in his place.
As issues were identified we came to an agreement on how to tweak the
design in a sensible way.</p>

<p>Ideally a design is so complete that it needs no clarification or
change, but this never happens in practice. So, the situation lent this
competition a distinctly real-world aspect: designs invariably change
during development, and developers sometimes have limited access to the
designer.</p>

<p>Both competitors demonstrated here that they can develop software
effectively "in the trenches," and produced admirable work here.</p>


<p>AN ANALYSIS OF THE SUBMISSIONS</p>

<p>Requirements of Distributed Simple Cache are relatively easy to state:</p>

<ul>
<li>* Coordinate updates between several caches on different hosts</li>
<li>* Address issues of server failure, concurrent updates</li>
</ul>

<p>This is easier said than done, both to design and develop.</p>

<p>Reviewers found both submissions good in terms of code quality and
meeting requirements. The key challenges in this development effort
were managing interaction between threads, and also dealing with server
failure cases. In fact, thread management became the defining aspect of
the on-site competition, so without further ado let's move on today's
events.</p>


<p>ON-SITE: APPEALS, A NEW REQUIREMENT, FINAL REVIEW</p>

<p>The initial scores for both submissions were extremely close as the
final round started, at 8:00 a.m., with aksonov at 85.31 and rnielsen
at 84.71 -- it was all but tied. In the next four hours, both would
have a chance to read their reviews for the first time, appeal review
items, polish their work, and implement support for a new requirement.</p>

<p>While both competitors started asking questions shortly after the 8:00
a.m. start time, the live chat with reviewers was fairly light during
the whole competition. There were some small questions, quickly
resolved, some discussion about required changes to Thread management
in one submission, and several clarifications about the new
requirement:</p>

<p>* Use TopCoder Software's Timer component to time execution of the
cache's get and put functionality</p>

<p>The challenge here was to quickly understand, configure and use a new
component -- the actual code needed to meet this requirement is simple.
Both competitors questioned whether they had understood the new
requirement during the chat, as they seemed to find it no problem, so
evidently neither had trouble with the Timer component. Both focused
time instead on tweaking development solutions.</p>

<p>aksonov and rnielsen submitted before noon and took a much-needed break
from the keyboard. Shortly thereafter, behind closed doors, reviewers
took over and put both submissions to the test, where it quickly got
interesting.</p>

<p>Reviewers ran into many test failures in aksonov's submission -- during
several test cases, including some of those supplied with his
submission, the component appeared to hang, while rnielsen's submission
passed the same test cases.</p>

<p>Reviewers examined the unit test output log file submitted with the
code, and found it empty -- possibly aksonov was also not able to get
the tests to complete? Did aksonov fall victim to a last-minute,
untested change? This is a very real risk in a timed development
competition like this, just as it is in the coding competition.</p>

<p>Reviewers worked past the scheduled review completion time to examine
this issue, and even recruited the design reviewers as a second set of
eyes. Ken_Vogel and mishagam led the investigation, and Ken came close
to pinpointing the issue -- subtle threading issues when the component
is shut down. But, reviewers could not identify the issue conclusively
in the time available today. All agreed that the unit tests had indeed
found a problem.</p>

<p>Both competitors put forth a great effort, but rnielsen prevailed in
this tough development round with a solid submission that survived the
pitfalls of this development project. BryanChen praised his
submission's code, saying that it was clean and flowed well. Good code
helped rnielsen hold his submission together today and emerge the
winner.</p>

<p>The competition was much closer than the final score would suggest, and
both deserve congratulations for demonstrating broad development skill
and ability to deal with changes and pressure in a software project!</p>
