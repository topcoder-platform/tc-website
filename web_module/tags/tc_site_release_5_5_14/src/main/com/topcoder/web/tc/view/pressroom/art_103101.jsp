						<P>A $100,000 payday awaits a 20-year-old UCF computer science major if he can outsmart 15 other competitors next month at an invitational computer programming tournament that 
						has drawn the nation's top coding wizards -- collegians and professionals alike -- in their quest for fame and fortune.</P>
						<P>Ambrose Feinstein, a senior and member of UCF's first-place finishing computer team in a five-state programming competition this month, will test his individual skills against the 
						nation's premier coders -- and perhaps start a personal fortune -- on Nov. 2-3 at the 2001 TopCoder Invitational Tournament at the Foxwood Resort Casino in Mashahtucket, Conn. A 
						first-place prize of $100,000 goes to the winner out of a $250,000 purse.</P>
						<P>Programmers from such schools as Stanford, California Institute of Technology, Cornell, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of California at Berkeley are heavily 
						represented in the finalist field.</P>
						<P>Feinstein, an Orlando resident, qualified for the championship based on his scoring in on-line elimination rounds. Scoring was based on ability to use a particular coding language 
						well and on writing good code quickly and accurately. The same scoring criteria will be used in the championship round.</P>
