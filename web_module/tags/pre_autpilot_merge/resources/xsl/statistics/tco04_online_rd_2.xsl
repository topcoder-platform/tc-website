	<h2>Match summary</h2> 

	<p> 
	Round two seemed very tricky for most coders, dispite the low
	point values for the easy and hard problems.  In fact, 9 red
	coders were eliminated, 6 of them scoring 0 points or less.  Most
	people believed that the low scored easy and hard were undervalued.
	It's often difficult to determine the value for greedy problems because
	you don't know how fast a coder can prove to his- or herself that the
	greedy algorithm works.  A tough but mostly standard level 2 problem
	was the only salvation for a few coders who were fooled by the greedy
	problems.
	</p> 

	<p>
	<b>haha</b> was the star of this round, scoring slightly less than
	<b>SnapDragon</b> in points, but taking the lead with two challenges.
	Heavyweights <b>radeye</b>, <b>snewman</b> and <b>tomek</b> rounded out
	the top 5.  Incidently, <b>Rustyoldman</b> was the only coder ranked
	below yellow who made the cut, but he changed colors in the process.

	<p>
	Usually easy problems don't make you think much, but this one
	was an exception.  Here we are looking for the maximum number
	of bags we have to buy.  Clearly we can't use brute force to
	find the worst case,  as there are way too many combinations.
	In one bag alone, there are 10,626 possible combinations of
	colors.  Figuring this out for thousands of bags would be
	undoable in the allotted time.
	</p>

	<p>
	However, for this problem, we are only interested in the very
	worst possibility.  To solve it, imagine we have 5 buckets, each
	representing a color.  We'll add beans to buckets one bean at a time.
	When the bucket has <i>quantity</i> beans in it, it is emptied, and the
	number of sets is incremented by one.  Each bucket represents beans of
	a certain color that aren't part of a set.  To maximize the beans
	placed into buckets, we want to fill each bucket with <i>quantity</i>-1
	beans.  At that point, no matter what color bean is next, a set is
	formed.  After the set is formed, the bucket is emptied.  To ensure the
	worst case, the next <i>quantity</i>-1 beans should go into the empty
	bucket.  Any other color, and another set is formed early.
	</p>

	<p>
	This greedy algorithm should be enough to code a solution which
	runs fast enough.  However, there is a constant time solution
	which uses the fact that the last state of the buckets is that
	4 of them are full of <i>quantity</i>-1 beans.  Therefore, the final number
	of beans required is:<br/>
	<pre>quantity * children + (quantity-1) * 4</pre>
	</p>

	<p>
	In all cases, we need to round up this to a multiple of 20,
	since even if we need only one bean, we need to buy a whole
	bag.  Therefore, the final formula is:<br/>
	<pre>(quantity * children + (quantity - 1) * 4 + 19) / 20</pre>
	</p>

	Many knowlegable coders will recognize this as the infamous
	traveling salesman problem.  Many people know that this problem
	is NP-complete, but with the number of locations limited to 15,
	a O(2<sup>n</sup>) solution will run in time.
	</p>

	<p>
	The first thing to note is that the time to move the pen is not
	the cartesian distance, but rather the maximum of the x and y
	distances.  This is because both motors can run simultaneously.
	</p>

	<p>
	To solve the graph problem, We'll use recursion with
	memoization of 2<sup>n</sup> * n states.  Part of the state
	will be a bitmask representing which lines have been drawn, and
	the other part will be which line endpoint the pen is located
	at.  The recursive function will return the minimum time needed
	to draw the rest of the lines.
	</p>

	<p>
	For each run of the recursive problem, we try drawing each
	undrawn line starting from either endpoint.  The new state is
	that the pen is on the other side of the line just drawn, and
	the bitmask has a bit added for the line just drawn.  We add on
	the time it takes to move the pen to the endpoint, and then to
	move the pen (while drawing) to the other endpoint.  By
	memoizing on the state, we can reduce the runtime to
	O(2<sup>n</sup> * n).

	It's that time of the year again!  Baseball is one of America's
	greatest games, and the race for the playoffs is generally very
	tense.  In this problem, we are trying to see if we can stop
	the worrying, and see if our team is out or in.
	</p>

	<p>
	This problem seems at first like it could be solved with
	maximum flow, but in the end, it turns out to have a very easy
	greedy solution.  You perform two checks on the team.  If it
	wins all its remaining games, is it still forced out of the
	playoffs, and if it loses all its remaining games, is it still
	in the playoffs.
	</p>

	<p>
	One of the other issues is to make sure the wins acheived in
	the rest of the season are consistent with the number of games
	played.  We know that each team will play <i>gamesLeft</i>
	games.  Each game is played by two teams, so the number of
	games left to be played by all the teams are <i>gamesLeft</i> *
	<i>numTeams</i> / 2.  The constraints guarantee that this is a whole
	number.  As it turns out, because of the way the constraints
	are, we don't have to keep track of which team plays who.  We
	just assign wins to whichever team we want.  All we have to do
	is to make sure no team gets more than <i>gamesLeft</i> wins
	added to their record, and that the total number of wins added
	equals <i>gamesLeft</i> * <i>numTeams</i> / 2.
	</p>

	<p>
	So keeping this in mind, to answer the first question, we
	assign <i>gamesLeft</i> wins to the team in question.  Then we
	want to assign wins to the other teams, trying to keep our team
	from being eliminated.  If there is no possible way to do this,
	the team is eliminated.  To keep the team at the same rank, we
	first can assign <i>gamesLeft</i> wins to all the teams that
	rank higher than it.  If there are any games left, we should
	first assign wins to teams lower than it, but only enough to
	make those teams tie the target team.  If we still have wins
	left to assign, we must assign those wins to the tied teams,
	but here, it is important to assign wins to teams which have
	more games left to play, as we can use up more wins on those
	teams without changing the rank.  If all this is done
	correctly, and the team still isn't in the top N ranking teams,
	it has been eliminated.
	</p>

	<p>
	A similar procedure is followed for the question of clinching.
	However, this procedure is a little simpler.  We want to see if
	it is possible for a team to not make it into the playoffs.  We
	still have the same constraints on the total wins assigned.
	Assigning wins to higher ranking teams doesn't help, since
	those teams cannot push our team out, so we assign wins to
	teams who are lower ranking until they have enough wins to just
	tie our team.  We choose the team to assign the wins to based
	on how close it is to our team's record.  The closer ones are
	chosen first because they use up fewer wins to tie our team.
	At the end, if the set of tied teams is not all in the
	playoffs, then the team cannot clinch.  If our team and all the
	teams tied with it are in the playoffs, then the team has
	clinched.
