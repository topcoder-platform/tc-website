            <p>As a condition of participation in the tournament, all information provided by you in your TopCoder member
            profile must be comprehensive, accurate and up-to-date. TopCoder may require you to complete an additional
            registration form to register for the tournament. In order to be eligible to participate in the tournament, you must
            have completed any and all registration forms required by TopCoder.</p>

            <p>As a condition of winning and redeeming a cash prize, winners will be required to return by Wednesday, November 12th a

            (iii) travel form, and (iv) IRS Form W-9 or W-8BEN, as appropriate, if one is not already on file with TopCoder.
            In completing the Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release, a winner (i) confirms his/her

            and other executables), and (vii) releases TopCoder from liability arising out of any prize won. TopCoder requires
            contestants to complete the Form W-9 or W-8BEN for tax reporting purposes. If prize notification is returned as
            undeliverable, or if the winner fails to return the Affidavit, or the W-9 or W-8BEN, as specified, the winner will
            be disqualified and the prize money won by the disqualified winner will be forfeited. Providing false information in
            the registration process or in the required forms described in this paragraph will disqualify a winner.</p>

            <p>By participating in a tournament and redeeming a prize, a winner releases and agrees to hold harmless TopCoder,
            its affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotion agencies, sponsors, and prize suppliers, and all of their
            respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents, from and against any and all liability for any
            loss, property damage or damage to person, including without limitation, death and injury, due in whole or in part,
            directly or indirectly, from or arising out of participation in this tournament, or participation in any
            tournament-related activity, or the receipt, use or misuse of a prize. TopCoder specifically disclaims all liability
            associated with, and makes no warranties with regard to, any prize given.</p>

            <p>In addition, all prizewinners agree to cooperate with TopCoder's publicity efforts, without further compensation.
            This includes the agreement to use their name, handle, address (city and state) and likeness for publicity purposes,
            where legal, for this or similar future tournaments, and to use the statements made by, or attributed to, the winners
            relating to TopCoder and any and all rights to said use, without further compensation.  Furthermore, all prizewinners
            agree to promptly notify TopCoder if a third-party contacts the prizewinner regarding employment opportunities
            and/or media interest as a result of the prizewinner's participation in the tournament.</p>

            <p>TopCoder reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to revoke any and all privileges associated with competing
            in this tournament, and to take any other action it deems appropriate, for no reason or any reason whatsoever,
            including if TopCoder suspects competitors of cheating, tampering with the entry process, the operation of the
            Web site, or the tournament process, or otherwise being in violation of the rules. TopCoder reserves the right to
            cancel, terminate or modify the tournament if it is not capable of completion as planned for any reason, including
            infection by computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention or technical failures of any sort.</p>
