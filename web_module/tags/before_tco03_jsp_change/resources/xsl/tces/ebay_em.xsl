<p>Hello [handle]:</p>

<p>eBay's mission is to provide a global trading platform where practically anyone can trade practically anything.  
You can find a lot of cool things on eBay.  But you won't find anything cooler than their jobs.</p>

<p>They enjoy their work and they'll be the first to admit it!  They think it's because they are doing something 
that has never been done before. Creating an incredible new space where buyers and sellers come together 
to exchange just about anything. All sorts of stuff, both new and used, like sports memorabilia, books, coins, 
stamps, toys, collectibles, and even cars and real estate. What they've done at eBay is promote the growth of 
communities where people can share similiar interests about things they have or want.</p>
	
<p>If you're ready to enjoy your work, check out our open positions:

<p>Thank you and, as always, good luck in the Arena!<br/>
