                        <p><strong>Online Elimination Rounds</strong><br/>
                        Everyone who competes in Round #1 must log in to the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than ten minutes prior to the start
                        of the online round.  <strong><em>All start times will be communicated in IST.</em></strong>  If a coder does not participate, for any reason, in an
                        online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition, and that coder will be
                        disqualified from the Contest. </p>

                        <p>All competitors who have been invited to compete will be randomly assigned to specific rooms, with up to 10 people in each
                        room.  TopCoder will determine all room assignments prior to the start of each online round. </p>

                      <p><strong>Scoring and Advancing During Online Rounds</strong><br/>
                        After each round of competition, the top scorers will be identified and will advance to the next round.  Coder advancement in
                        all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round (see Competition Round Structure)
                        for each coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a greater-than-zero (i.e., positive) point total. The structure of the
                        online rounds is as follows:</p>

                        <p><strong>Round #1</strong>
                        <ul><li>Up to 500 coders will compete in Round #1 and up to 250 will advance.  The 250 highest scoring competitors will advance
                        to Round #2.  Each coder must have positive points to advance, so if there are less than 250 competitors who score positive points,
                        only those competitors with a positive point total will advance.  </li></ul></p>

                        <p><strong>Round #2</strong>
                        <ul><li>Up to 250 coders will compete and up to 25 will advance.  The 25 highest scoring competitors will advance to Round #3.
                        Each coder must have positive points to advance, so if there are less than 25 competitors who score positive points, only those
                        competitors with a positive point total will advance.</li></ul></p>

                          <p><strong>Round #3</strong>
                        <ul><li>Up to 25 coders will compete in the Championship Round being held onsite at Verizon's Chennai facility.  Each finalist
                        is responsible for arriving at Verizon's facility to compete.</li></ul></p>

                        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>  In the event of a tie for any advancing position, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during the previous rounds of the Contest.</li>
                           <li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The handles of the winners of each round of competition will be published on TopCoder's website at <A href="http://www.topcoder.com/verizon">www.topcoder.com/verizon</A>
                        within twelve (12) hours of the completion of the round.  In addition, each winner will be sent an email within twelve (12) hours of the completion of
                        each round confirming his/her advancement to the next round of competition.</p>



                        <p><strong>Competition Round Structure</strong><br/>
                        Each online and onsite round of competition consists of three phases: the Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase.
                        (Note: the format of these competition rounds is similar to the format of TopCoder's Single Round Matches.)</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The Coding Phase</strong> is a timed event lasting 75 minutes where all contestants are presented with the same
                            three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a
                            problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated on the total time elapsed
                            from the time the problem was opened to the time it was submitted.</li>

                            <li><strong>The Challenge Phase</strong> is a timed event lasting 15 minutes wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge
                            the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points
                            by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 50 points
                            as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition. </li>

                            <li><strong>The System Testing Phase</strong> is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged.
                            If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were
                            originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code
                            submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered
                            flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges
                            from the Challenge Phase will be added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Onsite Championship Round</strong><br/>
                        The 25 advancers from Round #2 must travel to Verizon's Chennai VDSI facility to compete in the Championship Round of the Contest.
                        Each finalist will be notified via email that he/she has advanced to the onsite final. Each finalist must confirm his/her attendance in
                        the Championship Round by Wednesday, November 5th at 9:00pm India Time.  If a contestant does not confirm his/her attendance in
                        the Championship Round by said date, he/she will forfeit eligibility to receive a prize, and his/her spot in the Contest will be given to
                        the next highest scorer from Round #2.  All finalists must arrive at Verizon's Chennai VDSI offices no later than 5:00pm India Time on
                        Friday, November 7, 2003.  If a contestant who has confirmed his/her attendance in the Championship Round does not arrive at Verizon's
                        offices by this time, he/she will forfeit eligibility to receive any prize. If a contestant is unable to attend the onsite rounds, he/she will
                        forfeit eligibility to receive a prize, and his/her spot in the Contest will be given to the next highest scorer from Round #2.</p>

                        <p>Verizon and TopCoder will NOT provide travel arrangements for each finalist.  All expenses to attend the onsite finals are the
                        responsibility of the finalist.</p>

                        <p>TopCoder will determine the room assignments for the Championship Round prior to the start of the Championship Round. </p>

                        <p>The Championship Round will be a single round of 25 coders. First, second, third and fourth place in the Championship Round
                        are determined by comparing the total points of each coder, with the highest point value placing first. The winner of the Championship
                        Round will be the coder with the highest point total for the round. In the event of a tie in the Championship Round, the tie will be
                        resolved in the following manner (in order):</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during Rounds #1 and #2</li>
                            <li>If a tie still remains in the Championship Round, then the prize money will be distributed equally amongst the tied coders</li>
                        </ul>
