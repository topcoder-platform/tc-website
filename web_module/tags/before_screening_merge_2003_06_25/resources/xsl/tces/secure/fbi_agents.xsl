<P>
<B>Special Agents</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Duties and Responsibilities:</B><BR/>
As the primary investigative arm of the federal government, the FBI is responsible for enforcing over 260 federal statutes and for conducting sensitive national security investigations.
FBI activities include investigations into organized crime, white-collar crime, public corruption, financial crime, fraud against the government, bribery, copy-right matters, civil rights violations, bank robbery, extortion, kidnapping, air piracy, terrorism, foreign counterintelligence, interstate criminal activity, fugitive and drug-trafficking matters, and other violations of federal statutes. 
The FBI also works with other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies in investigating matters of joint interest and in training law enforcement officers from around the world. 
When you join the FBI, you join a united effort against crime. It's a rewarding career for anyone who has the ability and desire to contribute to the proud history and bright future of today's FBI.
</P>

<P>
<B>The FBI Academy at Quantico, VA:</B><BR/>
Each new Agent serves a two-year probationary period upon entering on duty with the FBI. However, preference eligible veterans serve a one year probationary period. At the FBI Academy, you will join a class of Special Agent trainees for 16 weeks of intensive training at one of the world's finest law enforcement training facilities. 
Your classroom hours will be spent studying a wide variety of academic and investigative subjects. The FBI Academy curriculum also includes intensive training in physical fitness, defensive tactics, practical application exercises, and the use of firearms. Several tests will be administered in all of these areas to monitor your progress. 
Upon successful completion of Academy training, you will graduate and receive the credentials of an FBI Special Agent.
</P>

<P>
<B>Your First Assignment: </B><BR/>
As a newly appointed Special Agent, you will be assigned to one of the FBI's field offices based on the current staffing and/or critical specialty needs. New Agents are permitted to make known their preference for assignment and consideration is given to your desires; however, assignment will be based upon the staffing needs of the FBI.
An Agent can generally expect to remain in his/her first office of assignment for a minimum of four years. Your first months will be guided by a veteran Special Agent who will help you apply the lessons learned at the FBI Academy. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Advancement: </B><BR/>
Throughout your career with the FBI, you can qualify for additional training and promotion to a variety of administrative and supervisory positions. 
Special Agents enter as GS 10 employees on the law enforcement government pay scale and can advance to the GS 13 grade level in field non-supervisory assignments. Promotions to supervisory, management, and executive positions are available in grades GS 14 and GS 15 as well as in the Senior Executive Service. All Special Agents may qualify for availability pay, which is an additional premium compensation for unscheduled duty equaling 25 percent of the Agent's base salary. 
As an FBI employee, you will be entitled to a variety of benefits, including group health and life insurance programs, vacation and sick pay, and a full retirement plan.
