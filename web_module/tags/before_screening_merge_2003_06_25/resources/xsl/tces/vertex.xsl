                        <p><strong>A Leader in Small Molecule Drug Discovery...</strong></p>

                        <p>Founded in Cambridge, MA in 1989, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated discovers, develops and markets small 
                        molecule drugs that address major unmet medical needs. We have more than 12 drug candidates in development to treat 
                        viral diseases, inflammation, cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurological disorders and genetic disorders.</p>

                        <p><strong><a class="bodyText" href="http://www.vpharm.com/PipelineChart.html" target="_blank">with a Proven Track Record...</a></strong></p>

                        <p>Vertex has created its pipeline using a proprietary, information-driven approach to drug design that integrates 
                        multiple technologies in biology, chemistry and biophysics, aimed at increasing the speed and success rate of drug 
                        discovery. Vertex's first approved product is Agenerase&#174; (amprenavir), an HIV protease inhibitor, which 
                        Vertex co-promotes with GlaxoSmithKline. Vertex's goal is to develop and commercialize a range of products for 
                        medically underserved diseases in the coming years.</p>

                        <p>Since 1991, Vertex has been traded on NASDAQ under the symbol VRTX.</p>

                        <p><strong>Vision</strong></p>

                        <p>A vision as great as this can only be achieved in an environment where creative and talented people can thrive.  </p>

                        <p>As we have grown in size from 10 to more than 1,000 people in the last eleven years, we have worked to develop an 
                        organizational structure that rewards collaborative effort and encourages interaction among people from across the 
                        company. From the start of a research program at Vertex, an interdisciplinary team of people focuses on maximizing 
                        the potential value of the final product in the medical marketplace. The free flow of information across disciplines, 
                        and the insight that emerges through open exchange and interaction, accelerates the drug discovery and development 
                        process and allows each product to reach its full commercial potential.</p>

                        <p>We are now entering a new period of growth, during which we will expand our capabilities to take advantage of 
                        the chemogenomics opportunity and commercialize a range of important new drugs.</p>

                        <p>As we pursue our vision for the future, we will continue to recruit top industry talent, and foster an integrated, 
                        team-oriented culture of innovation.</p>

                        <p><strong>Environment</strong></p>

                        <p>An Environment that Encourages Employees to Excel...</p>

                        <p>Vertex has engineered an integrated team environment where employees set high goals and work together to

                        professional development. We encourage employees' participation in educational seminar series. Our extensive 
                        collaborations allow our employees to interact with colleagues from leading research centers and companies based 
                        in Cambridge, MA and Oxford, U.K., as well as throughout the world.</p>

                        <p>We encourage our employees to continue building their knowledge base and skills. Our scientists regularly 
                        publish their research in peer-reviewed journals. Along with tuition reimbursement, we offer a home computer 
                        reimbursement program for every employee. Vertex is committed to employee wellness and provides an on-site 
                        fitness facility for its employees. Our employee assistance program offers resources and guidance on parenting, 
                        elder care, financial planning and wellness. </p>

                        <p>Vertex's success stems from the contributions of employees with diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise. 
                        We are actively committed to maintaining a diverse workplace.</p>
