<p>Dear [handle]:</p>

<p>Sony's employment philosophy is simple--find the best people and give them the opportunity to become even better. 
To maintain and build upon their position as a leader and innovator in current and emerging markets, they look for 
individuals with an entrepreneurial spirit who can combine their unique talents into a team effort. Sony places a high 
value on diversity of skills, experiences and cultural background. They recognize that the contributions of each Sony 
employee are vital to the company's success; their talents, creativity and drive play a key role in determining the 
Sony of the future.  See the opportunities waiting for you at <A href="/?&amp;t=tces&amp;c=sony" target="_blank">Sony</A></p>

<p>Thank you, and as always, good luck in the Arena!<br/>
The TopCoder Employment Services Team</p>
