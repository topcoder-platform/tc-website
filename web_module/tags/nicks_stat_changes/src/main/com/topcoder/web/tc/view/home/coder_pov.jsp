 Both divisions faced a harder set of problems than usual in SRM 183.  Most notable was the Division 1 hard, which only <b>tomek</b> was able to solve
successfully, and for only 322 points, but it was still enough to give him the win for the match.  There were plenty of challenges to be had on that problem,  and although
<b>bladerunner's</b> solution was not successful, 4 of his challenges were.
