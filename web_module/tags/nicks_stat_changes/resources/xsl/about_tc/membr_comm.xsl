					<B>TopCoder is a commercial site</B>
					<P>TopCoder was created as a way to measure the varying skill levels for developers. TopCoder uses the performance information of our rated members to find employment opportunities for those members. Given the participation level we enjoy from our members, TopCoder also provides sponsorship packages to those companies who serve the technical community.</P>
					<P>TopCoder will seek employers and sponsors that can provide the most value to our members. It is TopCoder's intention to help developers increase their skill level, knowledge of technology, and value to employers. Therefore we will work with employers and sponsors that have the caliber of opportunities and technologies commensurate to our members</P>
					<P>Many developers enjoy competing at TopCoder. The competitions are entertaining, educational and provide members with a strong sense of inclusion in an elite group; similar to the feeling for members of a professional sports league. The prizes and recognition are important to our members as well.  TopCoder asks that our members be open and responsive to our employers and sponsors.</P>
					<B>Measuring Talent</B>
					<P>At no time in the history of computing has it been more important for companies who live and die by systems to find the highest level of talent possible. TopCoder has created an objective platform of fair competition. Employers can measure the ability of programmers through statistical analysis; code samples and ranking amongst a representative sample.  TopCoder is the only real-time, online programming competition, which provides employers with valuable, position-specific data on the raw ability of a developer.</P>
					<P>TopCoder will identify those positions, within companies, which we feel offer the highest level of opportunity to our members. TopCoder will only approach rated members for open positions and will communicate regularly with those members. It is important that members, who request to be included in jobs and employment information, be responsive to communications from TopCoder.</P>
					<B>Helping to build relationships</B>
					<P>Companies, such as Sun Microsystems, are sponsoring the annual tournaments and weekly single round matches in order to strengthen their position with technologists.</P>
					<P>It is important that all current and future members understand that being part of the TopCoder community is first and foremost about competition and that these competitions are made possible (in part) by technology companies interested in doing more to build their business and further their technology offering to the global community. TopCoder will ask members to interact with sponsors from time to time. We may ask members to visit a sponsor's site, or to evaluate a piece of software, or to participate in a dialogue with our sponsor about their products.</P>
					<P>Obviously, TopCoder cannot force members to participate, we can only advise you that the lack of this participation from our members on a consistent basis, will mean that our offering will not grow into the many new areas of competition and content we have planned. Additionally, the level of cash and prizes earned by proving one's ability in the Competition Arena will be diminished.</P>
					<P>The competition and content possibilities for TopCoder are boundless. The growth of TopCoder depends heavily on the support of employers and sponsors. We encourage members to participate fully in the further development of the TopCoder community.</P>
