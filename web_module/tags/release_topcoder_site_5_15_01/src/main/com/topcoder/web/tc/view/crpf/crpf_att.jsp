				<p>The AT&amp;T Foundation invests globally in undertakings that address a range of public concerns. Our focus of support is in the following areas:</p>
				<p><img src="/i/events/crpf03/edon2.gif" width="126" height="120" align="left" alt="Student."><span class="section-title"><b>Education</b></span><br>
				We invest in projects that use technology to improve the quality of teaching and learning; we support programs that develop the skills needed for a competitive workforce, particularly in the information technology industry; and we promote efforts to advance diversity in education and the workplace, with special interest in increasing the participation of women and minorities in science, math, engineering and technology. <a href="http://www.att.com/foundation/programs/education.html" target="_blank"><img src="/i/events/crpf03/btn_more.gif" width="51" height="16" border="0" alt="More."></a>

				We support programs that address community needs, encourage volunteerism, and promote leadership with integrity.  We do this by providing grants to organizations that are dedicated to promoting diversity, providing leadership development, encouraging youth, protecting the environment, and supporting communities and families in need. <a href="http://www.att.com/foundation/programs/community.html" target="_blank"><img src="/i/events/crpf03/btn_more.gif" width="51" height="16" border="0" alt="More."></a></p>

				We support artistic work that fosters communication, builds diverse audiences,
				and inspires innovation and learning in communities; we also target initiatives
				that help women and artists of diverse cultures bring their work to wider audiences. <a href="/foundation/programs/arts.html" target="_blank"><img src="/i/events/crpf03/btn_more.gif" width="51" height="16" border="0" alt="More."></a></p>

				The AT&amp;T Foundation helps extend the reach of AT&amp;T employees' community involvement efforts by matching employee contributions to educational and cultural organizations and by providing grants to recognize employee volunteer efforts in communities located in all areas of the country. <a href="http://www.att.com/foundation/employee/employee.html" target="_blank"><img src="/i/events/crpf03/btn_more.gif" width="51" height="16" border="0" alt="More."></a></p>

				<p>With the great number and range of potential projects to fund, the AT&amp;T Foundation focuses its grant decisions in various ways. Here are just three important yardsticks:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Programs that serve the needs of people in communities where AT&amp;T has a significant business presence.</li>
				<li>Initiatives that use technology in inventive ways. We're confident that information and communications technology will hasten the solutions to some of our most intractable social problems. Like telecommunications itself, many of these solutions will cut across the boundaries of time and place to bring people closer together and fresh ideas to fruition.</li>
				<li>Groups that our employees are actively involved with as contributors and/or volunteers. These include organizations that focus on education, community services, the environment, and arts and culture.</li>

				<li>Dedication to serving our customers optimally, and to building long-term relationships with our partners in the community.</li>

				<p>In 2001 and 2002, AT&amp;T's total contributions (including cash contributions and product donations) amounted to nearly $150 million.  The AT&amp;T Foundation contributed more than $85 million of this total. The rest came in the form of direct contributions and product donations from AT&amp;T business units and divisions. In addition, tens of thousands of AT&amp;T
employees and retirees contributed their volunteer efforts to charitable organizations in their local communities.</p>
