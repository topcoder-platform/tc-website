        The AMD Multicore Threadfest ("Competition") will take place between March 10, 2008 and December 31, 2008 and will consist of four (4) rounds (each a "Round"). Each Round will award a total prize purse of $5,000. TopCoder members must register for each Round . Registration may occur at any time between the opening of registration for that Round  to the deadline for submissions for that Round.  All competitors who have registered for the current Round will immediately be given access to the competition problem statement for that Round.</p>
        
        <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Eligibility</span><br />
        The competition is open to all TopCoder members who are at least 18 years of age as of the start date of each Round.</p>
        <p>All competitors must be registered members of TopCoder and must have agreed to the rules on this page prior to participating in this Competition and any Round.</p>
        <p>TopCoder members who are 18 years of age or older as of the start date of each Round are eligible to win cash prizes, unless otherwise prohibited.  The Competition and each Round is void in the Quebec province of Canada, and elsewhere where prohibited by applicable law.  Prizes will not be paid to residents of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria.</p>
        <p>Employees of TopCoder and AMD and those involved in the development, production (including prize suppliers and sponsors), implementation and distribution of this Competition and their advertising or promotion agencies, parent companies, service providers, agents, officers, subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other persons or entities directly associated with the Competition and members of the immediate families and/or persons living in the same household as such persons, are ineligible to enter or participate in the Competition.</p>
        
        <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Match Structure</span><br />
        There will be four (4) Rounds in the Competition.  The format of each Round is similar to a TopCoder Marathon Match. The rules in place for such competitions as of January 30, 2008, as may be amended by these rules or the rules for this Competition, will apply to this Competition.</p>
        <p>Each Round shall consist of two phases: the Coding Phase and the System Testing Phase.</p>
        <p><em>Coding Phase</em><br />
        The Coding Phase is a timed event where all competitors are presented with the same problem statement. The criteria for scoring will be provided in the problem statement and may change in each Round. During each Round, each competitor may submit one of two types of submissions: an Example Submission or a Full Submission.</p>
        <p>Each Example Submission is run against the example test cases listed in the problem statement and detailed feedback is provided to the competitor. Each Full Submission is run against a more complete set of test cases which are unknown to the competitor and the competitor receives a provisional score only. The duration of the Coding Phase is two weeks.</p>
        <p><em>System Testing Phase</em><br />
        The System Testing Phase is applied to the most recent Full Submission for each competitor. During system testing, each Full Submission is run against a large number of sample cases not disclosed previously to the competitors, and is scored according to the criteria specified in the problem statement. Once the system tests are completed, competitors are ranked according to their score on the system test cases. The score a competitor's Full Submission receives is determined solely by the system testing.</p>
