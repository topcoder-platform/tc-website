<br clear="all">

<p>Welcome to the first edition of &ldquo;Know Your Hero,&rdquo; a series of interviews with the coders, designers and developers who are at the top of the ratings.</p>
<p>In this edition, I present an interview with Bruce Merry (TopCoder Handle: <tc-webtag:handle coderId="251074" context="algorithm"/>; Algorithm Rating: 3100; Marathon Matches Rating: 2268). <tc-webtag:handle coderId="251074" context="algorithm"/> is currently positioned at no. 4 in the world in algorithm competitions, and is one of the few to cross the coveted 3000-point mark in the ratings. </p>
<p>We talked about his preparation for the TCO finals, his hobbies, future plans, SRM strategies and the difference between SRM and Marathon matches. </p>
<p><strong>How long have you been engaged with programming? How did you start?</strong></p>
<p>I've been programming almost as long as I can remember. My parents both program, so they encouraged me as a child. I started with Logo and moved on to GWBasic, then Pascal. </p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>When did you start to realize that you would achieve so much?</strong></p>
<p>I guess it was when I was still in primary school. In my last year of primary school, I came second in the national high school contest. Then at IOI I got gold medals in my last two years.</p>
<p>But I'm still surprised to find myself currently at #3 on the TopCoder ranking. I knew I was good, but some of the top guys are really amazing. </p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>What are your hobbies, other than TopCoder?</strong></p>
<p>What, there are other things to do than TopCodering? </p>
<p>OK, seriously, I do some other programming challenges, but also read books, watch movies, play table tennis. I'm a serious fan of Monty Python too. </p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>How do you approach an algorithmic SRM event?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of it is about having the right mindset - believing that you can solve the problems and having faith in your solution. At the moment I'm working in the order easy-medium-hard. I usually submit as soon as I can solve all the sample cases, although depending on the problem I might test some corner cases as well. </p>
<p>Something I learned from <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10574855" context="algorithm"/> is to then test the problem immediately, rather than hoping there is time to come back and do it later. </p>
<p><strong> How did you go about preparing for the TCO07 Finals?</strong></p>
<p>Initially, I just took part in as many SRMs as I could. When I started, I switched to VIM on Windows, which is the environment I used at the finals. I also worked through old finals in the practice rooms. Finals tend to have tougher problems than SRMs, so it was important to make the mental adjustment. </p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>How have TopCoder events changed your programming?</strong></p>
<p>It's definitely made my coding faster and less error-prone. I don't type any faster, but I've picked up a lot of shortcuts and so I write less code. And the less code you write, the less chance there is of bugs. </p>
<p>I also used to try to fully optimize almost everything, as a result of experience with IOI and similar challenges. I now take the approach that I try to write the minimum amount of code to get the job done, even if it's a bit slower to run. </p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>What topics of study would you suggest to a new TopCoder member who wants to excel in algorithmic challenges?</strong></p>
<p>You should definitely work through the <a href="/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=alg_index">Algorithm tutorials</a> on the TopCoder site - they're all important. I guess dynamic programming and graph theory are the two pillars on which most challenge problems are based. </p>
<p>But no amount of book-learning is going to help without experience. The best way to get good at TopCoder is to take part in a lot of matches and, after each match, find out what theory you needed to solve the problems. </p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>What is your proudest moment in TopCoder? How did you feel?</strong></p>
<p>I would say advancing from the final round at the TCCC06 finals. I was really happy about it, and a little bit disbelieving. </p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>You have done exceedingly well in both Algorithm SRMs and Marathon Matches. What's the difference in the approach required by these kinds of competition?</strong></p>
<p>There is an element of planning in both, but to excel in an algorithm match you have to dive in quite quickly and trust your instincts. </p>
<p>In a marathon match it pays to take things slowly and methodically, making notes of different ideas, analyzing things theoretically before implementing them, and testing changes one at a time instead of in a big bunch. </p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>What are your future plans?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment I'm finish up a PhD. After that I'm hoping to find a job in the computer graphics industry. Hopefully I'll still be able to compete in TopCoder. </p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>They say, &ldquo;Behind every man&rsquo;s success, there is a woman&rdquo;, maybe you could coin a new phrase. &ldquo;Behind every man&rsquo;s successful coding, there is a _________&rdquo;??</strong></p>
<p>Debugger? </p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the main key to your success?</strong></p>
<p>I think its proficiency for algorithms and reasonable consistency. I haven't won many SRMs, and I don't have the highest submission success rate, but I usually get 2 or 3 problems in reasonably quickly and I don't often crash out totally. </p>
<p><strong>A piece of advice to fellow TopCoder members?</strong></p>
<p>Practice, practice, practice. </p>
