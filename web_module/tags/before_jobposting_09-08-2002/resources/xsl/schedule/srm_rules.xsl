        <b>Prizes</b><br/>
Each competition room will have a maximum of 10 coders. There will be 2 divisions. Division I is 1200 rating and up, while Division II is below 1200. The single round match room assignments will only place members of like divisions together. Any member who changes divisions as a result of a rating change will compete in their new division in the next rated event following the rating change. Coders must place with a positive point total to collect any prize. 
        <br /><br />
All prizes will be calculated at the conclusion of the match, based on the ratings of the coders in each room, as well as the final scores of each coder.
Prizes are calculated based on the ratings of the coders who are assigned to a given room.  The higher the ratings of the coders assigned to a given room, the higher the prize purse for that room will be.  A detailed explanation of how the prizes will be calculated can be found at <a href="/?t=support&amp;c=divisions">http://www.topcoder.com/index?t=support&amp;c=divisions</a>.
        <br /><br />
All prizes will be awarded at the conclusion of the single round of competition.
Any and all applicable taxes on a prize are the sole responsibility of the prize winner.

              in this event, but <b><i>all start times will be communicated as <xsl:value-of select="/TC/SCHEDULE/Rounds/Round[RoundId=$roundId]/RoundSegments/RoundSegment[SegmentId='2']/StartTimeZoneLong"/>, so contestants in different time zones must adjust accordingly.</i></b>  
              All competitors who have registered for the online tournament 
              round will be assigned to a specific tournament room.  
              TopCoder will perform the room assignments prior to the start of 
              a tournament round, in a manner such that only coders in the same 
              division are placed in a room and the average competitor 
              rating for each room is similar.

            <b>Upon Entering an Online Tournament Round</b><br/>
            Each online tournament round consists of three phases:
            the coding phase, challenge phase, and the testing phase.
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>The Coding Phase</b> is a timed event where all
              contestants are presented with the same three questions representing
              three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels
              of point earnings potential.
              Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of
              any solution that successfully compiles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>The Challenge Phase</b> is a timed event wherein each competitor
              has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code.
              A successful challenge will award 50 points to the challenger, and any 
              points gained by the submitter for the problem will be lost. 
              Unsuccessful challenges will cost the challenger 50 points as a
              penalty, applied to their total score in that round of competition.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>The Automated Testing Phase</b> is applied to all submitted code that has
              not already been successfully challenged.  If TopCoder finds code that is flawed,
              the author of that code submission will lose all of the points they earned for that
              code submission.  The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output
              from the code submission to be correct.  If the output from a coder's submission does 
              not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed.  The same set of input/output 
              test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Scoring during Online Tournament Rounds</b><br/>
The prize winners of each room will be determined as follows:  Coder standing in each room is determined by comparing the point values for all coders in the room for all three phases of the round.  Those with the top three positive point values in the room, place in first, second, and third.  In the event of a tie (unlikely, since scoring is calculated to .01), all coders who have greater than zero points tied for a place will split that prize money combined with the prize money of lesser place(s) equal to the number of coders tied.  For example:  if three coders within a room are tied for first place with positive point totals, they split the combined prize money for first, second and third place.  No other coders are paid.  If two coders are tied for first place with positive point totals, they split the first and second prize money combined, and the coder with the next highest positive point total wins the third place prize money.
            <br /><br />
            All contestants, who opened any problem during the round, will have their ratings 
            adjusted up or down to reflect their performance, based on TopCoder's rating formula.  
            Contestant ratings play no role in a Coder's final standing in the competition room.
          </li>

To register, login to the Tournament Arena applet, click on the 'Main' menu, and

              TopCoder members from all over the country will be participating
              in this event, but <b><i>all start times will be communicated as <xsl:value-of select="/TC/SCHEDULE/Rounds/Round[RoundId=$roundId]/RoundSegments/RoundSegment[SegmentId='2']/StartTimeZoneLong"/>, so contestants in different time zones must adjust accordingly.</i></b>  
              All competitors who have registered for the online tournament 
              round will be assigned to a specific tournament room.  
              TopCoder will perform the room assignments prior to the start of 
              a tournament round, in a manner such that only coders in the same 
              division are placed in a room and the average competitor 
              rating for each room is similar.  
              The Online Round will begin at 
              <xsl:value-of select="format-number(/TC/SCHEDULE/Rounds/Round[RoundId=$roundId]/RoundSegments/RoundSegment[SegmentId='2']/StartHour,'##')"/>:<xsl:value-of select="/TC/SCHEDULE/Rounds/Round[RoundId=$roundId]/RoundSegments/RoundSegment[SegmentId='2']/StartMinute"/>&#160;<xsl:value-of select="/TC/SCHEDULE/Rounds/Round[RoundId=$roundId]/RoundSegments/RoundSegment[SegmentId='2']/StartAMPM"/>

            <b>Upon Entering an Online Tournament Round</b><br/>
            Each online tournament round consists of three phases:
            the coding phase, challenge phase, and the testing phase.
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>The Coding Phase</b> is a timed event where all
              contestants are presented with the same three questions representing
              three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels
              of point earnings potential.
              Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of
              any solution that successfully compiles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>The Challenge Phase</b> is a timed event wherein each competitor
              has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code.
              A successful challenge will award 50 points to the challenger, and any 
              points gained by the submitter for the problem will be lost. 
              Unsuccessful challenges will cost the challenger 50 points as a
              penalty, applied to their total score in that round of competition.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>The Automated Testing Phase</b> is applied to all submitted code that has
              not already been successfully challenged.  If TopCoder finds code that is flawed,
              the author of that code submission will lose all of the points they earned for that
              code submission.  The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output
              from the code submission to be correct.  If the output from a coder's submission does 
              not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed.  The same set of input/output 
              test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Scoring during Online Tournament Rounds</b><br/>
            All contestants, who opened any problem during the round, will have their ratings 
            adjusted up or down to reflect their performance, based on TopCoder's rating formula.  
            Contestant ratings play no role in a Coder's final standing in the competition room.
          </li>
        </ul>
