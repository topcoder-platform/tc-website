                        <p>TopCoder, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, launched TopCoder High School in December 2002.
                        Through its partnership with the Connecticut Association of Schools (CAS), TopCoder hosts competitions for
                        Connecticut high schools students and provides the means for these academically inclined students to showcase their
                        skills alongside classmates during statewide team competition.  The TopCoder High School regular season will
                        commence in March 2003 and will culminate in May 2003 with a statewide championship competition between the
                        best computer science high schools in Connecticut.</p>

                        <p><strong>FOR MEMBERS</strong><br>
                        TopCoder High School competitions are designed for those academically inclined students already interested in
                        computer science.  The key to the competition process is the immediacy and objectivity of each match.  During a
                        TopCoder High School match, competitors do not wait for results or an announcement of winners from a panel of
                        judges that can take days or even weeks to arrive at a decision.  Each TopCoder High School match ends with a System
                        Test Phase and competition results are posted immediately. <a href="?module=Static&d1=about&d2=about_member"><strong>Read&#160;more</strong></a></p>

                        <p><strong>FOR SPONSORS</strong><br>
                        TopCoder High School provides sponsoring companies the ability to proactively and directly support and promote
                        high school math and science programs within their communities.  It also allows companies to reach a desirable and
                        targeted market of high school consumers and their families.  Sponsorship of these academically competitive events
                        may further position a company as a leader in the community and provide benefit to those students who previously
                        had no "playing field" to showcase their skills. <a href="?module=Static&d1=about&d2=about_sponsor"><strong>Read&#160;more</strong></a></p>
