                        It is hard to top <tc-webtag:handle coderId="15498334" context="algorithm"/>'s and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10574855" context="algorithm"/>'s <a href="/tc?module=Static&d1=features&d2=062507" target="_blank">pre-blogs</a> and really who cares what admins really think anyway (well, besides us admins of course).
                        
                        <br /><br />
                        Anyway, to steal a leaf from <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10574855" context="algorithm"/>'s style (yes, I realize the metaphors are mixed - it is to provide some added enjoyment to non-native English speakers), thought that I'd also start my blog with a bit of reminiscing.  I've been a TopCoder member since August 2002, but never made it to an on-site event until November 2006 at the <a href="/tc?module=Static&d1=tournaments&d2=tccc06&d3=movies" target="_blank">TCCC</a> in San Diego.  And let's face it, I did not get there as a member, but took the somewhat more convoluted, if easier, path as a TopCoder employee.  But get there finally, I did (channeling Yoda), and here are the top 10 things that I learned from that experience:
                        
                        <ol>
                        <li>Get to the UBS booth early - their free (and tasty) chocolates disappear like magic.</li>
                        <li>Practice pronouncing "<tc-webtag:handle coderId="10574855" context="algorithm"/>'s" name many times in advance before you try to say it live on a webcast.</li>
                        <li>If you are only 5 ft 2 inches and are made to stand between <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7267401" context="algorithm"/> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="303644" context="algorithm"/> during a live webcast, ensure you have a clause in your Rider contract that provides you with a box to stand on while doing the interview (the same rule applies to interviewing <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8357090" context="algorithm"/>).</li>
                        <li>Visit the NSA booth.  Everything on display is super-fun and geek-worthy.  And if that is not enough, they have to kill you once you know too much.</li>
                        <li>The white couches at the AOL booth are the most comfortable seating you can get in the competition arena.
                        <li><tc-webtag:handle coderId="262056" context="algorithm"/> looks waaaay too relaxed to be human during algorithm competitions.  I am not that relaxed taking a bubble bath.</li>
                        <li><tc-webtag:handle coderId="270505" context="algorithm"/>, Ken Vogel and Jeremy Schaap are much better than me at technical commentary and belting out snappy stats.  But undoubtedly I win when it comes to snazzy hair ornaments! (I'm competitive by nature, even though a girl.)</li>
                        <li>T-shirts with your TopCoder handle embroidered on it is the coolest article of clothing ever.</li>
                        <li><tc-webtag:handle coderId="275071" context="algorithm"/> is the member who is most obviously recognizable from his picture on the TopCoder website.</li>
                        <li><tc-webtag:handle coderId="14999860"/> rocks.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        Bonus: If you are told to put your arms around the people that you are interviewing on a webcast, there is always the chance that one of them will hug back!
                        
                        <br /><br />
                        
                        I'm sure that the TCO07 will be equally enlightening, so keep reading this space - unless of course you have something better to do like read <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10574855" context="algorithm"/>'s and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="15498334" context="algorithm"/>'s contributions - I know that I will be. Stay tuned!
