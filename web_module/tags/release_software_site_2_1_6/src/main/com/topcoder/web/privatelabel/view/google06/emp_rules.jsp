            <span class="subTitle">Summary of the Tournament</span><br>
            The Google&#153; Code Jam 2006 Employee Competition will take place between September 5 and October 27, 2006. 
            This algorithm competition will consist of one (1) online qualification round, two (2) online elimination 
            rounds and one (1) online final round.
            <br><br>

            <b>Eligibility</b><br>
            Employees and interns of Google who are at least 18 years of age as of September 5, 2006 are eligible to 
            compete in the Employee Competition.  
            <br><br>

            <b>Registration</b><br>
            Registration for the Google Code Jam 2006 Employee Competition will open at 9:00 AM EDT on Monday, 
            August 28, 2006, and will close at 9:00 AM EDT on Tuesday, September 5, 2006.  There is no limit to the 
            number of registrants in the competition, however each individual may only register once.
            <br><br>
            <span class="bigRed">Employees and interns MUST register with your "@google.com" email address in order to be considered part 
            of the employee track of the Google Code Jam. This is how you will be identified as a Google Employee. 
            You should only use the TopCoder account conversion if your TopCoder account is currently set up with a 
            "@google.com" email address.</span>
            <br><br>
            Google employees and interns may register for the competition <b><A href="/pl/?module=Static&d1=google06&d2=emp_jump_reg" target="_blank">here</A></b>.
            <br><br>

            <b>Qualification Round</b><br>
            The Qualification Round will be open for 24 hours from Noon EDT (GMT/UTC -4) on Tuesday, September 5, 2006 
            through Noon EDT (GMT/UTC -4) on Wednesday, September 6, 2006.
            <br><br>

            The Qualification Round will consist of two phases: the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase.
            <ul>
                <li>The Qualification Round Coding Phase is a timed event where contestants are presented with one
                    of five possible problem sets. Each problem set contains two questions representing two levels
                    of complexity and, accordingly, two levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question
                    are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based
                    on the total time elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.
                    Competitors will have 60 minutes to complete either or both of the problems. The 60 minutes will
                    begin to elapse once the first problem is opened. The timer in the coding window will count down
                    to the end of the 60 minutes. A competitor who begins the qualification attempt within the final
                    60 minutes of the Qualification Round will have less than 60 minutes to attempt
                    qualification.</li>
                <li>The Qualification Round System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code. If the TopCoder
                    System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the
                    points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a
                    set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a
                    coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The
                    same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given
                    question.</li>
            </ul>

            The Qualification Round will contain (10) virtual rooms and five (5) problem sets. The top 20 scorers
            from each of the five problem sets presented during the Qualification Round will be eligible to compete
            in Round 1 of the Employee Competition.
            <br><br>

            <b>The Competition Field</b><br>
            Up to 100 individuals will qualify to compete in Round 1. The top 50 scorers from Round 1 will advance 
            to Round 2. The top 25 scorers from Round 2 will advance to the online Championship Round. 
            <br><br>
            The Rounds will be held on the following dates:

<span class="subTitle">About the Tournament</span><br>
<b>Use of Plugins in the Competition Arena</b><br>
The use of external TopCoder Arena plugins or any modifications to the TopCoder Arena functionality is strictly
prohibited.
<br><br>
<b>Languages</b><br>
The competition is available in five programming languages - Java, C++, C#, VB.NET and Python.
<br><br>
<b>NOTE:</b> All submissions have a maximum of 2 seconds of runtime per test case.  This limit is used in harder problems 
to force submissions to be of a certain complexity.  Because the inherent speed differences between Python and the other 
offered languages is large, some problems may require extra optimization or not be solvable using the Python language.
<br><br>
<b>Code Obfuscation</b><br>
Intentional obfuscation of code submissions is not allowed. Any code submission that contains obvious and deliberate code 
obfuscation will be rejected and any points received for that submission would not count towards your final score. For the 
purpose of this policy obfuscation is defined as "An obvious and deliberate attempt to disguise the true behavior or nature 
of the code." In ALL cases, TopCoder / Google will make the final decision as to whether or not a code submission has been 
intentionally obfuscated. In some cases, TopCoder / Google may decide to "nullify" any unsuccessful challenges that have 
been applied against a code submission that is determined to be obfuscated. We encourage any competitor to notify us in the 
event that you feel that a code submission violates this policy.
<br><br>
<b>Online Elimination Rounds</b><br>
Everyone who competes in an online round must login to the Competition Arena no later than five (5) minutes prior to the start 
of the online round. Google employees and interns from around the world may be participating in the online rounds, but all 
start times will be communicated as Eastern Daylight Time (UTC/GMT -4), so contestants in different time zones must adjust 
accordingly. If a coder does not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated 
as an automatic loss in that round of competition. 
<br><br>
All competitors who have qualified for an online round will be assigned to one specific room for each round of the competition.
<br><br>
<b>Scoring and Advancing</b><br>
After each round of competition, the highest scorers from across the room will be identified and will advance to the next online 
round.  Coder advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round for
each coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater-than-zero) point total. The 
structure of the online rounds is as follows:
<br><br>
<b>Online Round #1</b><br>
Up to 100 coders will compete in Round #1 and up to 50 will advance.  The highest 50 scorers from the room will advance to Online Round #2.  
<br><br>
<b>Online Round #2</b><br>
Up to 50 coders will compete and up to 25 will advance.  The highest 25 scorers from the room will advance to the online Championship Round.  
<br><br>
<b>Championship Round</b><br>
Up to 25 coders will compete and the coder who finishes with the highest score will be the winner of the Employee Competition.  
<br><br>

<b>NOTE:</b> In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the online rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:
<ul>
<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during the previous online rounds of the tournament (excluding the Qualification Round).</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<b>Competition Round Structure</b><br>
Round 1, Round 2 and the Championship Round (excluding the Qualification Round) consists of three phases: the Coding
Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. The Qualification Round will consist only of the Coding Phase and
System Testing Phase. (See "Qualification Round" above for details regarding the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase
of the Qualification Round.)
<ul>
    <li>The Coding Phase is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing
        three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question are
        awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time
        elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.</li>
    <li>The Challenge Phase is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of
        other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points
        by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger. Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point
        reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.</li>
    <li>The System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If
        the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the
        points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs,
        expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not
        match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be
        applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be
        added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</li>
</ul>
