            <h2>Eligibility</h2>

            <p>
            All TopCoder members who are 18 years of age or older may attempt to
            qualify for the TCO.  500 members will qualify either through
            Qualification Rounds or by receiving an automatic berth.
            </p>

            <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Qualification Rounds</span><br />
            All members who have not already qualified for the Coding Tournament can compete in
            the Qualifying Rounds.  The top 200 scorers from each of the two
            Qualification Rounds will be eligible to compete in Online Round 1.
            The Qualification Rounds will be held on Tuesday, October 7th
            and Thursday, October 9th. </p>

            <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Automatic Berths</span><br />
            The 100 highest rated TopCoder members as of October 7th who have
            participated in at least three (3) TopCoder rated events (i.e., Single
            Round Matches and previous tournaments) prior to October 7th, with at
            least one (1) of those events being between July 7th and October 7th,
            will receive an automatic berth into Online Round 1.

            Please note that the top 100 rated members with automatic berths will not be permitted

            in Qualification Round #1 will not be permitted to compete in Qualification Round #2.
