<strong>Competitions</strong><br/>
The JavaOne<sup>SM</sup> Coding Challenge provides a hands-on experience for conference attendees to apply what they learn during the conference tracks.  Following each day's technical presentations, attendees can proceed to the TopCoder arena where attendees will attempt to solve various problems in the "Competition Arena."  At the conclusion of each day's Qualification Round, a 4-person competition will be held.  The four individuals who achieved the highest cumulative score for their respective problem set during the Qualification Round will be invited to compete in the afternoon's competition. The schedule of competitions is as follows:

<strong>Competition Structure</strong><br/>
Java will be the only allowable programming language in the competition.  Each competition will have 3 phases - the Coding Phase, the Challenge Phase and the System Testing Phase.  The following describes the different phases of competition:

<ul>
<li><strong>The Coding Phase</strong> is a timed event where all contestants are presented with either one of two possible questions or the same questions, depending on the round.  If an individual is presented with more than one (1) question during a round of competition, the questions will have varying levels of complexity and, accordingly, varying levels of point earnings potential. Multiple problems may be worked on in any order, and at the same time.  A solution to a problem may be submitted multiple times, however a point penalty of 10% of the maximum value of the problem will be assessed for each submission.  Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened to the time it was submitted, regardless of the time it took to submit any previous solutions to that problem, if any.  (NOTE:  Each participant will be presented with one (1) of two questions in the Qualification Round.  Two (2) questions will be presented to each participant during each competition.)</li>
<li><strong>The Challenge Phase</strong> is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.  (NOTE:  There is no Challenge Phase during the Qualification Round.)</li>
<li><strong>The System Testing Phase</strong> is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</li>
</ul>

During each competition, the Coding Phase will last 60 minutes.  After a 5-minute intermission, the Challenge Phase will commence and will last 10 minutes.  The System Testing Phase begins immediately following the end of the Challenge Phase.
<br><br>
<strong>About the Prizes</strong><br/>
Prizes will be awarded to each person who participates in the Qualification Rounds.  The winner of each day's competition will be awarded a "grand" prize.  The prizes are as follows:
