Since everyone (or at least <tc-webtag:handle coderId="21494813" darkBG="true" /> enjoyed the competitions I posted yesterday, I have decided to add another component to the TopCoder Open - the BEST DRESSED COMPETITION!  There's a common misconception that computer scientists and engineers don't dress well -- but this post will prove everyone wrong (or right... it depends who's reading this).  On with the contest!  
<br><br>
<b>Best Dressed in Las Vegas</b>
<br><br>
1. I've entered myself into the contest.  I know what you're thinking - Grace, you're such a great dresser, how will the others even come CLOSE to beating you and your classic style? Here I'm sporting the sock/sandal combo as well as my Illini colors.  By the way, the sock/sandal combo is the MOST uncomfortable thing EVER!  
<br><br>

<br><br>
You might be thinking, wow, let's declare her the winner NOW, but read on and you'll see why it's such stiff competition this year at the TCO...
<br><br>
2.  <tc-webtag:handle coderId="262056" darkBG="true" />, must be friends with my roommate, Joe Xu; they both love to pop their collars!   The question is, who do you think pulls it off better? 
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/omgrace-08-02.jpg" /></div>
<br><br>
(Actually, the real question is - how does <tc-webtag:handle coderId="262056" darkBG="true" /> keep his collar popped WHILE playing DDR?  Now THAT takes talent).  
<br><br>
3. The next contestant, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="15891862" darkBG="true" /> is definitely one of my favorites.  How does he pull off the headband and pointy shoes?  He definitely looks like he's striking a pose - bonus points!
<br><br>

<br><br>
4. Here we have <tc-webtag:handle coderId="260835" darkBG="true" /> at the Gameworks event.  Brrrr it's COLD in Las Vegas!  I wonder if that sweater is warm enough for the desert...
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/omgrace-08-04.jpg" /></div>
<br><br>
5. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="310430" darkBG="true" /> carries off the sweater around the waist well; so well that we should just call off the contest and announce the winner now. But we will continue...
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/omgrace-08-05.jpg" /></div>
<br><br>
6. I like <tc-webtag:handle coderId="15485957" darkBG="true" />'s style because he's a forward thinker with his blavy outfit...
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/omgrace-08-06.jpg" /></div>
<br><br>
7. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8357090" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8357090" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8357090" darkBG="true" />.  There's not much I can say about this competitor... except that I love everything he's worn this past week.  How many guys do you know will wear a shirt with hearts, stars, rainbows, and clouds?  My only own complaint - where are the BUTTERFLIES?!  Also, I LOVE LOVE LOVE his scarf!  I can't say enough about it... maybe he'll let me borrow it later and I'll post a pic!
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/omgrace-08-07.jpg" /></div>
<br><br>
8. I entered one of the spectators into the best dressed competition because I love this purse... I think I might have one in navy at home.  First it's the purse, next it's the fannypack!
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/omgrace-08-08.jpg" /></div>
<br><br>
And the winner is... <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8357090" darkBG="true" />!  No one can beat his shirt/scarf combo - and no one EVER will... don't even TRY!  He's also my favorite for the overall winner of the TopCoder Open algorithm competition - I'll post on it soon!
