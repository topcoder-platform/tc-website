Functional Test Plan

This document shall serve as a guide for end-to-end functional testing of
this application.  Herein described are the tests which should be
authored/performed once a suitable testing framework is determined.

Setup:
To support testing, the system will have to be initialised with data to
support the following (all of which must be cleaned up after execution):
One component project in "Accept Submissions" phase
	["project1"]
One user with Reviewer privileges assigned as Reviewer, Aggregator, Final
	Reviewer, Failure Tester and Screener for "project1"
	["reviewer1"]
Two users with Reviewer privileges assigned as Reviewer for "project1"
	["reviewer2" and "reviewer3"]
One user with Admin privileges assigned as Product Manager of "project1"
	["admin"]
One user with Designer/Developer privileges assigned to for "project1"
	["designer" with USER_ROLE_ID=1000]
Screening Scorecard Template with one yes/no question and one
	rating/response question
Review Scorecard Template with one rating/response question

Insert Statements to construct each document within the system separately
	This includes (for submission 1000):
	screening scorecard not marked as completed adding up to a score of 80
	a review scorecard for "reviewer1", "reviewer2" and "reviewer3" with
	scores of 70, 80 and 90 respectively, not marked as completed
	a test case review
	an aggregation worksheet (drawing on the above reviews) not marked
	as completed
	aggregation reviews from "reviewer2" and "reviewer3"
	a final review scorecard (drawing on the above aggregation
	worksheet) not marked as completed
	a submission entry
	a final fix entry
	a final review entry

One solution file
	["solution.jar"]
