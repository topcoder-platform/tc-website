                        TopCoder has created an online venue that brings together some of the most talented developers 
                        from around the world. Each week, TopCoder hosts an online programming competition 
                        <a href="?module=Static&d1=corp&d2=spon_prog&d3=srm_index">(Single Round Match)</a> during 
                        which developers compete for ratings, bragging rights, and a 
                        <a href="?module=Static&d1=corp&d2=spon_prog&d3=tourny_index">tournament</a> invitation.</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="bodySubtitle">First of Its Kind</span><br>
                        TopCoder competitions offer a venue previously unavailable to the programming world&#151;the ability
                        to conduct real-time competitions that are judged immediately and objectively. With TopCoder, technologists 
                        from around the world are able to compete online and in a short and concentrated period of time. Moreover,
                        with each of the weekly Single Round Matches (SRMs) lasting only 90 minutes, programmers don't have 
                        to sacrifice as much free time to compete and have the chance to compete more often.</p>

                        TopCoder's Sponsorship Program provides companies with an ability to educate, interact with, and brand 
                        themselves to the membership.  This is accomplished by putting sponsoring companies in front of developers 
                        in the most applicable places and at the most visited times.</p>
