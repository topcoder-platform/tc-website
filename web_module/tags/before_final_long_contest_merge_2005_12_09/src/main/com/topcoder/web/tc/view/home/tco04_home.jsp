			The four top seeds met up in the finals for the ultimate coding showdown.  Would it be the methodical Canadian, the excitable Pole, the child prodigy, or the old timer?  snewman submitted the easy problem first, proving that he still has what it takes to compete with the young guns.  But SnapDragon and reid were right behind, with a spread of only 1.4 points.  It was the favorite, tomek who submitted last, coming in four minutes later.  All coders than moved on the medium problem, which was quite simple if you saw how to do it.  SnapDragon and reid were fastest, taking 9 and 10 minutes, respectively, given the Canuck a 17 point lead. <br/><br/> tomek was way behind when he finally submitted his medium for 305 points.  However, he was well within striking distance, as neither SnapDragon or reid were able to quickly solve the hard.  With about 12 minutes remaining, tomek turned in the tough one, and took over the lead.  Yet, he had a bug in his medium problem, and his resubmission put SnapDragon and reid back within the realm of possibility, if only they could solve the hard problem.<br/><br/> But, as time ticked down, both of them gave up, and tomek  went into the challenge phase with a commanding lead.  So long as all his solutions held up, there was no way anyone could catch him, and as the challenge phase dwindled away it looked increasingly unlikely that tomek would be unseated.<br/><br/> Though speculation was rampant, no one knew who won for over half an hour after the end of the coding phase.  But, when the results came in, the top four coders proved why they were the top four, as none of their solutions failed - giving tomek his third win in as many events.  SnapDragon won second, reid third, and snewman took fourth.  Congratulations to all of the finalists for a spectacular job making it to the final four.

			When asked what he liked the most about the winning submission, reviewer TheCois replied that he admired the great amount of flexibility it offered.  He also liked how the design was both easy to implement and to use.
			<br/><br/>
			The URL History component, the component the designers competed on, maintains a dynamic list of URLs on a per-user basis.  The URLs are added to the list as they become available, and the user is allowed to retrieve them in sorted order.  The component is required to be extensible to allow the user to define new ways to sort the URLs.

			When asked what the most challenging part of the development was, reviewer WishingBone mentioned both pluggable persistence and the testing of the distributed aspect of the component.  He liked the way the winning submission addressed both of these challenges.
			<br/><br/>
			The Idempotency Manager, the component the developers competed on, is responsible for managing server responses to possibly redundant client requests.  The component keeps track of requests as they are received and remembers the response generated by the server.  If a duplicate request is received, the Idempotency Manager simply provides the previously stored response.
