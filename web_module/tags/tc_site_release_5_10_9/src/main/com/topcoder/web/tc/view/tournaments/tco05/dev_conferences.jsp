TopCoder Solutions: Identity & Access Management</b><br>
Most people think of security as restricting access to information, but when done correctly the greatest value is realized by increasing the flow of appropriate information to the appropriate people.
<br><br>
Increasingly, employees find themselves burdened with different logins to several different applications.  Forgotten passwords or lag in user creation adds to delays in basic business operations across the enterprise. Operating and maintaining a help desk to create and maintain these users is often costly.
<br><br>
With a proven track record of success within Fortune 100 organizations, TopCoder Software's identity and access management solutions centralize users and passwords, allowing organizations to reduce maintenance cost, improve accessibility and enforce consistent security policies. Utilizing TopCoder's Component-Based Methodology provides a flexible, standardized and easily maintained solution that is capable of working with industry leading security products.
