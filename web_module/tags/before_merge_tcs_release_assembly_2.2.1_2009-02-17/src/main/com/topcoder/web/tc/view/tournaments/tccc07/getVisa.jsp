                <h2>Do I need a visa?</h2>
                <p>All travelers entering the United States must present either a passport or a visa. If you do NOT have a passport, or you are from a country that does NOT participate in the Visa Waiver Program, you must apply for a visa.</p>
                <p>The following countries DO NOT require a visa to enter the United States:<br />
                <a target="_blank" alt="Countries that DO NOT require a visa" href="<tc-webtag:linkTracking link='http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/without/without_1990.html#countries' refer='TCCC07_getVisa' />">http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/without/without_1990.html#countries</a></p>
                
                <h2>Why should I get it early?</h2>
                <p>Getting your travel documents well in advance of your travel dates is important. If you require a visa, the application process could be lengthy. In some countries, it can take over a month. <a href="/tc?module=Static&d1=features&d2=073007" target="_blank">We strongly suggest you begin the process as soon as possible.</a></p>
                
                <h2>What is involved in applying for a visa?</h2>
                <p>The visa application process is an interview at the US Embassy explaining your trip to the United States. You should apply for a travel/tourist visa and be sure to let them know that you are only staying in the United States for a short time. It's a good idea to have the following information available at your interview:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An official letter of invitation from TopCoder (please see below)</li>
                        <li>Proof of residency in your home country</li>
                        <li>Evidence of employment and community ties, such as a copy of your marriage license or university documents</li>
                        <li>Your resume</li>
                    </ul>
