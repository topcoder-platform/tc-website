                        <p>TopCoder High School competitions are designed for those academically inclined students already interested in
                        computer science.  The key to the competition process is the immediacy and objectivity of each match.  During a TopCoder
                        High School match, competitors do not wait for results or an announcement of winners from a panel of judges that can
                        take days or even weeks to arrive at a decision.  Each TopCoder High School match ends with a System Test Phase and
                        competition results are posted immediately.</p>

                        <p>Each contest is simple. In each match, three problem statements with ascending point values are presented. The coder
                        to submit the most accurate solution in the shortest amount of time is awarded the most potential points. The key is that
                        a coder's submission is challenged not only by the TopCoder system, but first by the other participating coders in the
                        match. A coder's entire potential point base (and possible win) can be altered should another coder find a means of
                        "breaking" the submission.</p>

                        <p><strong>Points and Ratings</strong><br>
                        The more a coder competes, the better their rating can become. Ratings are the key determining factor for establishing
                        the competition field for the High School Tournament to be held at the end of the regular season.  Each coder's rating is
                        based on several factors, but the basic idea is that ratings are based upon the points gained in a given match, the number
                        of matches competed in, and how that stacks up against other coders with similar points and matches.</p>

                        <p>As you look through the site, you will see color coding with member's handles. These colors indicate the rating level
                        of that member. Participating members (those who compete versus spectate) are able to view each other's profiles, past
                        code submissions, statistics and more.</p>

                        <p><strong>There is no cost to <a href="?module=Static&d1=registration&d2=registration">register</a> or participate in
