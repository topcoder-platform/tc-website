<tr><td class="light"><b>TAG</b></td><td class="light">sun_1:  ;-))</td></tr>
<tr><td class="dark"><span class="bigRed">sun_1</span></td><td class="dark"><span class="bigRed">It's hard to describe this, but essentially think of the difference as follows:</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="light"><span class="bigRed">sun_1</span></td><td class="light"><span class="bigRed">- you get to customize your components using property sheets and customizers, rather than reading taglibs and setting attributes in a JSP</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="dark"><span class="bigRed">sun_1</span></td><td class="dark"><span class="bigRed">- you get to drag & drop components on each other to databind or link components</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="light"><span class="bigRed">sun_1</span></td><td class="light"><span class="bigRed">for example in Creator you can drag from a textfield to an inline error message to automatically bind the error source of the error message component to validation errors in the textfield</span></td></tr>

<tr><td class="light"><span class="bigRed">sun_1</span></td><td class="light"><span class="bigRed">So it's a lot more WYSIWYG than JSP based development</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="dark"><span class="bigRed">sun_1</span></td><td class="dark"><span class="bigRed">Behind the scenes of course JSF uses JSP</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="light"><span class="bigRed">sun_1</span></td><td class="light"><span class="bigRed">so it's just a really nice abstraction layer on top</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="dark"><span class="bigRed">sun_1</span></td><td class="dark"><span class="bigRed">plus a good rendering kit abstraction such that the components, and the markup they render, are separate</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="light"><span class="bigRed">sun_1</span></td><td class="light"><span class="bigRed">that makes it possible for a component to be configured independent of its output artifacts - it could render to HTML, or to VT100 terminals, or using fancy AJAX JavaScript stuff in a browser, or to mobile devices</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="dark"><b>mess</b></td><td class="dark">sun_1: How difficult is it to use a different render other than JSP</td></tr>

<tr><td class="dark"><span class="bigRed">sun_1</span></td><td class="dark"><span class="bigRed">Pops - that's correct, it copies the component jar into the project. That way if you've upgraded to a more recent version of the component library in your palette,</span></td></tr>

<tr><td class="light"><b>Pops</b></td><td class="light">sun_1: yeah - another question - at some patch level you improved the process to use complib's rather than .jars - do you know which patch level that was implemented in?</td></tr>
