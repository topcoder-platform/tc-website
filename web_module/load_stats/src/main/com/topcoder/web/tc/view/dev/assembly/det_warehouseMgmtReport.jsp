<span class="bigTitle">Warehouse Management Phase 1 Reporting</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The Warehouse Management System project will increase productivity at TopCoder's client, cut costs drastically, and provide them with real time, on-demand reports.
<br><br>
The report will be written in MS SQL Server/Report Server and will provide the client powerful information that they are currently missing.  These reports will serve two basic functions:
<ul>
<li>First, they will present the company with its current inventory.  These reports will be used for almost every aspect of the company, including sales, accounting, planning, allocating, and logistics.</li>
<li>Second, these reports will include transaction summary reports.  These will be used as an audit trail to track items and to measure efficiency.</li>
</ul>
Each report will consist of a filter screen and a repot detail.  Many of the items on the filter screens will be drop downs driven from the tables specific to that attribute.  
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
This assembly competition will consist of creating projects, editing projects, viewing projects, performing various project operations (i.e. performing submission, screenings, uploading test cases), ending phases and posting deliverables.
