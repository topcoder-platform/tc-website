<span class="bigTitle">Time Tracker Time, Expense and Reporting</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
TopCoder intends to streamline its time and expense reporting efforts. The current process requires employees and contractors to complete Excel spreadsheets and submit them to HR.  This process is extremely resource intensive and does not allow for reporting or integration with other systems. 
<br><br>
The Time Tracker application will replace the manual time and expense entry process.  The new application will allow users to enter their time and expenses via a web interface, eliminating the need for employees and contractors to use spreadsheets. Employees and contractors will also be able to view their time and expense reports, providing a quick overview of their hour and expense totals.
<br><br>
The administrative portion of Time Tracker will eliminate the need for HR to compile numerous spreadsheets into a more workable format.  HR will be able to manage client and project lists easily.  The reports provided to HR will be extremely beneficial, consisting of Employee, Contractor Project and Client reports. These reports will allow management an easier view into resource utilization, resource allocation and financial calculations.  Managers will also have the ability to approve and/or reject contractors' time reports, allowing both the contractor and the manager quick access to approval information.
<br><br>
Although the application will be initially used by TopCoder, the intention is to build the application in a generic fashion such that it could be used by any organization.
<br><br>
