               <blockquote>
               <h2>Prizes</h2>
               <p>All competitors who raise a minimum of $50 USD will be awarded a commemorative t-shirt.</p>

               <p>All competitors who raise a minimum of $100 USD will be put into a grand prize drawing.  A competitor will receive one
               entry into the drawing for every $100 he/she raises.  (For example, if a member raises $300, he/she will receive 3 entries
               into the drawing.)  In the event TopCoder draws a member who is also one of the 4 top scorers or top 4 fund-raisers, another
               name will be drawn.

               <p><strong>Grand Prizes</strong><br />
               Up to a total of 10 members will win a grand-prize.  The grand-prize winners are as follows:<br />
               <ul>
               <li>4 highest scoring competitors in Round 3</li>
               <li>4 members who raised the most money as of 11:59pm on November 10th.  Members must raise a minimum of $500 to
               be awarded this grand-prize<br>
               <b>NOTE:</b> In the event of a tie for funds raised, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:<br>
                     <ul>
                     <li>The winner will be the competitor that raised the tied amount first</li>
                     <li>If a tie still remains, then the winner will be the competitor who advanced farthest in the tournament.</li>
                     <li>If a tie still remains, then the winner will be the competitor who had the highest score in the last round.</li>
                     </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2 members will be randomly chosen on November 11th to receive a grand-prize.  All members who raise a minimum of
               $100 will be entered into the drawing.  Members will receive one chance for every $100 he/she raises</li>
               <li>If a top four point scorer is also a top four fundraiser, then TopCoder will choose an additional wildcard from the random drawing.</li>
               </ul>

               <p>The grand prize is an expenses paid trip to New York City on Monday, November 24th to attend <a href="/tc?module=CRPFStatic&d1=crpf&d2=crpf_overview"><i>A Magical Evening</i></a>,
               the annual star-studded gala ball benefiting CRPF. <i>A Magical Evening</i> will be held at the Marriott Marquis at 5:00pm. If a grand-prize winner is
               unable to attend <i>A Magical Evening</i>, he/she will forfeit his/her eligibility to receive a prize, and his/her prize will be given to the next eligible
               member (i.e. next highest scorer if a high-scorer can not attend, the next highest fund-raiser if a top fund-raiser can not attend, etc.). </p>

               <p>TopCoder will provide travel arrangements for each winner, up to a cost of $1,000 per person.  (That is, if a contestant's
               airfare is greater than $1,000, the contestant will be responsible for the difference between the cost of the airfare and $1,000.)
               In addition, TopCoder will provide overnight accommodations and travel arrangements to and from the airport to your hotel.  All
               other expenses are the responsibility of the member.</p>
