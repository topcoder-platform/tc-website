                        <h2>Do I need a visa?</h2>
                        <p>
                        All travelers entering the United States must present either a passport or a visa. If you do NOT have a passport, or you are from a country that does NOT participate in the Visa Waiver Program, you must apply for a visa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The following countries DO NOT require a visa to enter the United States:<br>

                        <h2>Why should I get it early?</h2>
                        <p>
                        Getting your travel documents well in advance of your travel dates is important. If you require a visa, the application process could be lengthy. In some countries, it can take over a month. We strongly suggest you begin the process as soon as possible. 
                        </p>
                        
                       <h2> What is involved in applying for a visa?</h2>
                        <p>
                        The visa application process is an interview at the US Embassy explaining your trip to the United States.  You should apply for a travel/tourist visa and be sure to let them know that you are only staying in the United States for a short time.  It’s a good idea to have the following information available at your interview: 
                        <ul>
                        <li>An official letter of invitation from TopCoder (please see below)</li>
                        <li>Proof of residency in your home country </li>
                        <li>Evidence of employment and community ties, such as a copy of your marriage license or university documents </li>
                        <li>Your resume </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
