<P><B>TopCoder Competitions Expand to High Schools</B><BR>
Host of Computer Programming Contests Offer Team Competitions at Connecticut High Schools; Connecticut Association of Schools (CAS) is the Premier Supporter of Academic Competitions </P>

<P>GLASTONBURY, CT., Oct. 30, 2002 - TopCoder, Inc., the leader in on-line programming competition and skills assessment, today announced it has partnered with the Connecticut Association of Schools (CAS) to expand its competitions to the high school level. These competitions will be a means for academically inclined students to showcase their skills alongside classmates during statewide team competition, and are a natural expansion of TopCoder's competitions given the success of its model at the collegiate and professional levels. </P>

<P>"We are excited about our collaboration with the CAS," said Drew Vaughn, vice president for TopCoder, Inc. "The executive group of the Connecticut Association of Schools has proven that they are at the forefront of promoting academic excellence alongside athletics in team competitions." </P>

<P><B>Coding as a High School Sport</B><BR>
"TopCoder's competition platform will allow students to compete in an academic arena, a direction in which we have been looking to expand. Being able to provide a means for students to represent their respective high schools and compete for school pride in a manner that has not previously been available is very exciting for us," said Mike Savage, Executive Director of CAS. "Expanding into the high school arena allows TopCoder to deepen its member base and continue to rate the computer scientists of tomorrow. The Connecticut Association of Schools is proud to promote excellence in mathematics and computer science through this academic team sport." </P>

<P>At www.topcoder.com, students will compete online in real-time against students from other schools. Using Java, C++ or C#, the most widely used programming languages in the technology workplace today, contestants will write solutions to algorithmic problems under tight time constraints. Scores will be calculated using TopCoder's objective assessment model and unique rating system, designed to fairly and accurately gauge a contestant's performance. Winning teams will be comprised of individuals who were the fastest to solve the problems with code that withstood the scrutiny of other contestants and TopCoder's system test. </P>

<P>Competing students will receive a rating based upon their performance in the competitions. This rating is a true indicator of programming talent and problem solving skills. This competitive experience offers students a way to differentiate themselves in the college admission process, and enables colleges to determine the most proficient programmers at a high school level for admission to their computer science and/or engineering programs. </P>

<P>There is no sign-up fee for schools or students. The program will be funded through corporate sponsorship. Interested companies should contact Drew Vaughn at (860) 633-5540 or <A HREF="mailto:dvaughn@topcoder.com">dvaughn@topcoder.com.</A></P>
