<p>Hello [handle]:</p>

<p>Sure, you like to use Yahoo!, but are you ready to BE a Yahoo?</p>

<p>There are lots of highly rewarding reasons to be a Yahoo&#151;from their highly creative (and highly 
casual) work environment, to the fact that they celebrate just about every success with a party (always 
featuring food). Not to mention their funky yellow and purple color scheme, which extends from the walls 
of their office to their cubicles and conference rooms. Foosball could be the official Yahoo! sport, and video 
games around the complex make for a fun work break. At Yahoo! they have a corporate culture unlike any 
other.</p>

<p>Yahoos are characterized as creative and innovative, dedicated, flexible, fun &amp; friendly, reliable &amp; 
trustworthy, smart, accessible, take charge/make it happen people, and proud to be part of Yahoo!</p>

<p>If you're ready to become a Yahoo, check out their list of open positions 
here: <A href="/?&amp;t=tces&amp;c=yahoo" target="_blank">http://www.topcoder.com?t=tces&amp;c=yahoo</A></p>

<p>Thank you and, as always, good luck in the Arena!<br/>
The TopCoder Employment Services Team</p>
