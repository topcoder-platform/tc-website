Steps to prepare the VM for testing: (these steps assume a fresh working VM)
1) Run DML: *
    - /test_files/scripts/tcs_catalog.dml
    - /test_files/scripts/informixoltp.dml
    - /scripts/tcs_catalog.dml
    - /scripts/informixoltp.dml
    - /test_files/scripts/rboard.dml
    
    * To aviod precedence conflicts, dml commands should be ran in the following order: (tcs_catalog)
    1) missing rows dml
    2) adding new types
    3) adding scorecards

        -- insert missing (old) review_resp rows for application testing
        INSERT INTO review_resp (review_resp_id, review_resp_name, phase_id) VALUES (19, 'Application Testing Reviewer 1', 124);
        INSERT INTO review_resp (review_resp_id, review_resp_name, phase_id) VALUES (20, 'Application Testing Reviewer 2', 124);
        INSERT INTO review_resp (review_resp_id, review_resp_name, phase_id) VALUES (21, 'Application Testing Reviewer 3', 124);
        
        -- rename "Application Testing" track to "Test Suites"
        update project_category_lu set name = "Test Suites", description = "Test Suites" where project_category_id = 13;
        update review_resp set review_resp_name = "Test Suites Reviewer 1" where review_resp_id = 19;
        update review_resp set review_resp_name = "Test Suites Reviewer 2" where review_resp_id = 20;
        update review_resp set review_resp_name = "Test Suites Reviewer 3" where review_resp_id = 21;
        
        -- add new Online Review project type for "Test Scenarios".
        insert into project_category_lu (project_category_id, project_type_id, name, description, create_user, create_date, modify_user, modify_date) values (26, 2, "Test Scenarios", "Test Scenarios", "System", current, "System", current); 
        insert into review_resp (review_resp_id, review_resp_name, phase_id) values (31, 'Test Scenarios Reviewer 1', 137);
        insert into review_resp (review_resp_id, review_resp_name, phase_id) values (32, 'Test Scenarios Reviewer 2', 137);
        insert into review_resp (review_resp_id, review_resp_name, phase_id) values (33, 'Test Scenarios Reviewer 3', 137);
        
        
        -- Sample screening and review scorecards for the new project types
        INSERT INTO 'informix'.scorecard(scorecard_id,scorecard_status_id,scorecard_type_id,
        [...]
    
2) Update web module source files in both tc and tcs accounts. (/web_module/ -> ~/web/)
    * Delete /web/src/com/topcoder/web/ejb/pacts/TestingCompetitionPayment.java in the VM since it was deleted in SVN.
3) Update online review source files and configurations in tcs account. (/online_review/ -> ~/OR_TRUNK/)
4) kill running jboss instances for tc, tcs and distui.
5) Build TCS:
    5.1) login as tcs
    5.2) cd web
    5.3) there is an environment issue with build_tcs.xml. You should copy over the attached file: 
         /test_files/tcs/build_tcs.xml -> ~/web/
    5.4) ant -f build_tcs.xml deploy
6) Build TC:
    6.1) login as tc
    6.2) cd web
    6.3) ant -f build_tc.xml deploy
7) Build Distributed UI:
    7.1) login as distui
    7.2) cd web
    7.3) ant -f build_distui.xml deploy
8) Build Online Review:
    8.1) login as tcs
    8.2) cd OR_TRUNK
    8.3) you should get latest trunk sources (they are not being refreshed with each VM instantiation)
    8.4) there is an environment issue with build.xml. You should copy over the attached file: 
         /test_files/online_review/build.xml -> ~/OR_TRUNK/
    8.5) ant deploy
9) There are some configuration files that are not updated in tcs account. To fix this you should:
    9.1) login as tcs
    9.2) copy included EmailEngine.xml (/test_files/tcs/conf/com/topcoder/message/email/) to 
         ~/jboss-4.0.2/server/default/conf/com/topcoder/message/email/EmailEngine.xml
    9.3) copy included Util.properties (/test_files/tcs/resources/security/conf/com/topcoder/security/) to 
         ~/jboss-4.0.2/server/default/conf/com/topcoder/security/Util.properties
    9.4) copy included OnlineReview.xml (/test_files/online_review/conf/) to 
         ~/jboss-4.0.2/server/default/deploy/review.war/WEB-INF/classes/
    9.5) copy included JNDIUtils.properties (/test_files/online_review/conf/com/topcoder/naming/jndiutility/) to 
         ~/jboss-4.0.2/server/default/deploy/review.war/WEB-INF/classes/com/topcoder/naming/jndiutility/
    9.6) copy included MessageResources.properties (/online_review/conf/) to 
         ~/jboss-4.0.2/server/default/deploy/review.war/WEB-INF/classes/
10) The VM may be missing the shared directory /captcha. You should create /captcha in case it's not there already.
   (you will need root access for this).
    Note that tc user must have read/write permissions over this directory.
    cd / ; mkdir captcha ; chown tc /captcha/ ; chgrp -hR app /captcha/
11) There is a new datasource used by tcs that is not deployed to the VM. Adding any for testing is ok, so these 
    lines should be added to /home/tcs/jboss-4.0.2/server/default/deploy/tcs_informix-ds.xml so that OR doesn't error:
          <no-tx-datasource>
            <jndi-name>TimeDS</jndi-name>
            <connection-url>jdbc:informix-sqli://env.topcoder.com:2021/informixoltp:INFORMIXSERVER=informixoltp_tcp</connection-url>
            <driver-class>com.informix.jdbc.IfxDriver</driver-class>
            <user-name>coder</user-name>
            <password>c0d3r4T</password>
                <new-connection-sql>set lock mode to wait 5</new-connection-sql>
        
                <!-- sql to call on an existing pooled connection when it is obtained from pool -->
                <check-valid-connection-sql>select '1' from dual</check-valid-connection-sql>
        
              <!-- corresponding type-mapping in the standardjbosscmp-jdbc.xml (optional) -->
              <metadata>
                 <type-mapping>InformixDB</type-mapping>
              </metadata>
          </no-tx-datasource>    
12) Start jboss instances:
    12.1) login as distui, jbb, ./start.sh
    12.2) login as tcs, jbb, ./start.sh
    12.3) login as tc, jbb, ./start.sh
13) Update the following query tool queries since they are not up to date in the VM : (tcs_dw database: DB:java:TCS_DW)
    13.1) comp_list
            Text for this query is located in /test_files/query_tool/comp_list.txt

    Note: if you are not familiar with query tool, check "Steps to update existing queries in Query Tool"    
    Note2: I have requested the admins to fix homepage_active_contest_summary command that is out of date in the new 
           VMs. If you are having troubles loading TC main home page, please let the admins know.
14) Update the following query tool commands/queries: 
    14.1) coder_all_ratings (informixoltp database: DB:java:OLTP)
            Text for this query is located in /query_tool/coder_all_ratings.txt
    14.2) contest_project_status (tcs_catalog database: DB:java:TCS_CATALOG)
            Text for this query is located in /query_tool/contest_project_status.txt
    14.3) project_detail (tcs_catalog database: DB:java:TCS_CATALOG)
            Text for this query is located in /query_tool/project_detail.txt

    Note: if you are not familiar with query tool, check "Steps to create new queries in Query Tool"
       
15) Since there are some missing/new images, update Cloud's apache 
    15.1) /test_files/tcdocs/i/* -> /mnt/apache/tcdocs/i/
    15.2) /tcdocs/i/* -> /mnt/apache/tcdocs/i/
    15.3) /tcsdocs/i/* -> /mnt/apache/tcsdocs/i/
16) Once all instances are running, you are all set for testing.

Note: due to the current state of the VM this deployment require several manual steps as described. If something
is not working after you deploy, please contact PM so that these issues can be handled during review.

Note2: due to some missing images in VM's apache, some pages could be missing icons or images, but this is not a 
code problem.

Note3: Past Contest page allows using phase id *or* project type id as a parameter. The link (left nav) was changed to 
  use the latter to make it consistent with the rest of the pages. It's recommended to change the rest as well since 
  using phase id is just a hack.

Testing tips:
- In order to create new projects please follow this document: 
  http://www.topcoder.com/wiki/display/docs/Creating+a+TopCoder+Competition
- After creating the components in the admin tool, you can go to online review and change their types. (editing
  the project)
- For all new projects you can:
    - check they are shown in Online Review
    - when they are open, they are shown in the corresponding active opportunities page
    - you can register to projects and navigate all related pages
    - you can register to the new review positions. Please follow /test_files/scripts/tcs_catalog.dml
      to see the test review board setup. This will help you check review board eligibility rules.
- To test Online Review automatic reviewer payment and Past Contests page you will have to:
    - Create a new project and drive it through the whole process until it's completed. 
        (if you are not familiar with this, see Steps to complete a new Online Review project)
    - Run TCS datawarehouse loader:  (This is required since the past contests page is populated with DW data. This is 
      why TCLoadTCS.java was updated)
        1) login as tc
        2) cd ~/web/scripts/dwload
        3) ./loadtcs.sh
        4) tail tcs_load.log
    - After doing this you'll be able to see the project in the past contest page and also query tcs_dw database
      to see that the new project types were loaded successfully.
        
        Note: the loader won't be able to complete all the work because of poor VM data state. But the loaded data
        until the failure is enough to test the past contests page.
        
        Note2: after loading you'll have to clean the cache (otherwise it will show an empty table). 
        For this you can simply login as cache user and kill and restart jboss.

Steps to update existing queries in Query Tool:
1) Go to http://tc.cloud.topcoder.com/query/query
2) login as heffan/password (check remember me) -> this is important
3) Select the corresponding Datasource as required.
4) Click on left menu "Query List" link.
5) Search for the specified query name and click "edit" next to it.
6) Make your changes and click save


Steps to create new queries in Query Tool:
1) Go to http://tc.cloud.topcoder.com/query/query
2) login as heffan/password (check remember me) -> this is important
3) Select the corresponding Datasource as required.
4) Click on left menu "New Query" link.
5) Complete query name and text, click save
6) if there are query inputs:
    6.1) click on "edit query input" link
    6.2) select the corresponding query input from the list, then click add
7) Click on left menu "New Command" link.
8) Complete command name and group, click save
9) Click on "edit command query" link
10) select the corresponding query from the list, then click add


Steps to complete a new Online Review project:
1) This assumes new projects are already created in Online Review. 
   (see http://www.topcoder.com/wiki/display/docs/Creating+a+TopCoder+Competition)
2) Edit the project and change project's type, also change Registration and Submission phases start date to the current
   date. Save.
3) Edit the project and open registration and submission phases.
4) Now you will be able to see the project in the active contest page. You can register a user and submit a solution. 
   Also reviewers can register. (Note: at the beggining review positions will be shown closed. You can wait or you can
   update review_project_detail query to not sum 12 hours to the review position open time:
   http://tc.cloud.topcoder.com/query/query?t=ModifyQuery&db=java:TCS_CATALOG&QueryId=13722)
5) Tip: After you have done this, Edit the project and change all durations to 0:01. (this will avoid problems later
   when trying to close phases)
6) At this point you'll have to run the project. Opening and closing phases one by one and completing all required
   deliverables as indicated.
7) Once you have closed final review, you should edit the project one more time and mark its status "complete".
