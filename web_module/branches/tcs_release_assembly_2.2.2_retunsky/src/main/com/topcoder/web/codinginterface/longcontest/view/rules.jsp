TopCoder members must register for the competition round. Registration may occur at any time from 12:00 Noon Eastern Time on 12/15/05 to 12:00 Noon Eastern Time on 12/22/05. All competitors who have registered for the competition round will immediately be given access to the competition problem statement for that round.

Each Marathon Match will contain a single problem.  The problem statement will indicate both the question presented to the contestant as well as how submissions will be scored.  Contestants will submit their solution which will immediately be put on a queue for system testing.  Once system testing is complete, the competitor will be assigned a score which will be available on the website.  Each competitor may submit as many times as they choose, however they may only submit once per hour.</li>
