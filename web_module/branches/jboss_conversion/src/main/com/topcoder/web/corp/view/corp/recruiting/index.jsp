                        <h3><strong>Candidate Identification</strong></h3>

                        <p>We provide employers with innovative programs designed to attract, identify, and evaluate collegiate candidates and
                        experienced professionals for full time employment consideration.  With a member base in excess of 30,000&#151;including
                        more than 17,000 students from over 750 schools&#151;employers obtain objective measurement detail about candidates, including
                        code samples and statistics, that is not found elsewhere.</p>

                        <h3><strong>Employment Advertisement and Job Postings</strong></h3>

                        <p>We launch a page on the TopCoder website allowing employers to introduce their company, the benefits of working in
                        their organization and display a list of job openings.  We include a link for a member to indicate interest in the position
                        advertised.</p>

                        <h3><strong>Targeted Email Campaign</strong></h3>

                        <p>We broadcast an email to those members opting to receive employment announcements, notifying them of the employer's
                        page.  Additionally, the employer has the opportunity to send one targeted email per month during the contract. The employer
                        can focus on one or multiple criteria, such as rating, state, professional/student status, school, and competition language.

                        <h3><strong>SRM Featured Employer</strong></h3>

                        <p>During the membership term, the employer receives time in the competition Arena as the Featured Employer.  As part
                        of the employment package, the employer will be promoted as the Featured Employer on the TC homepage, member homepage,
                        SRM summary page, and competition schedule page, as well as in the applet and practice rooms.</p>
