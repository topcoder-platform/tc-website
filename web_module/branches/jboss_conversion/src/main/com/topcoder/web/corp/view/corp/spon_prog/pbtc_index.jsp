                        <p>TopCoder can conduct online and onsite programming competitions using the TopCoder Arena Applet for
                        designated developers (employees, conference attendees, etc.). This service includes the use of the competition
                        process, problem sets, scoring engine, administration and match reporting.</p>

                        <p><font size="2"><strong>Create Your Own Developer Event</strong></font><br>
                        Managing and conducting a programming competition can be extremely difficult. By the time
                        a company designs, constructs, and receives legal approval, it will cost you valuable resources and great expense.
                        TopCoder has created a competition platform that allows companies to conduct developer contests at their
                        conferences, product events, through their developer portals, and in-house throughout the calendar year as
                        an incentive, and a way to motivate their developer community. These competitions provide an opportunity
                        to conduct a competition style programming event that draws programmers together for a consolidated period
                        of time and capture the interest of the participating developers to gain the recognition from their peers and
                        management.</p>

                        <p>These competitions also create an opportunity for interaction with developers, identify top developers,
                        and create tie-ins to today's technologies.  They also represent chances to improve corporate morale, build
                        excitement within the developer community in a credible manner, and differentiate your company in the
                        mindset of your developers through this hands-on experience.</p>

                        <p>TopCoder's developer competition platform has captured the attention and  credibility of the developer
                        community worldwide.</p>
