<strong>Algorithm:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22825384">Kriii</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Algorithm problem in June and why?</strong><br />
MuddyRoad. It was very strange problem to me. Thus, it was a difficult problem to think of a solution.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
I study for university entrance examination <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':-(' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new TopCoder member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m new TopCoder member too. Therfore, I want some advice too. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Design: <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=15391415">winterflame</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/winterflame.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2476" src="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/winterflame-242x300.png" alt="" width="242" height="300" /></a><br />
<em>winterflame</em></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Design contest in June and why?</strong><br />
It was QMATS contests. On the one hand, it was written by my favorite writer MiG-29, on the other hand, the large scope makes the contests pretty challenging in a short time.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
Playing with my 2-year old daughter, movies, music, walking, and doing some cooking.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new TopCoder member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Keep trying new things and never give up easily.</p>
<p><strong>Development:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22889341">tangzx</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/dsc_4191.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2477" src="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/dsc_4191-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><br />
<em>Traveling in Hangzhou</em></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Development contest in June and why?</strong><br />
System Assembly &#8211; Omicron SciApp System Assembly 1.0, because it didn&#8217;t require competitor to write much code, just need to investigate and integrate some existing components/frameworks. I really like this kind of contest.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
Usually working, I&#8217;m a student thus sometimes I need to finish some tasks given by my mentor. Now in my free time, I like playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_football">foosball</a> and kinect, they&#8217;re all interesting. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new TopCoder member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Having fun with coding, and have a rest if you feel really tired. Happy working will lead to good results.</p>
<p><strong>Studio:  <a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=diskoverx">diskoverx</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/photo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2478" src="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/photo-300x298.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="298" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Studio contest in June and why?</strong><br />
My Favourite contest was Inspire Zero Robotics Front End Storyboard. I won second place.</p>
<p>Well, I don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s my favourite. But it was fun designing the pages of Zero Robotics Website.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not designing, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
Actually, I&#8217;m doing my B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) in Electronics and Communication. So, I hardly get time to participate in Studio Contests.</p>
<p>Assignments, projects, and labs keep me busy all the time. Still, am trying to spend time here, with you guys <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new Studio member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m not a pro to give advice. But, all I do know is &#8221; No pains No gains &#8220;. Work hard and you will get what you deserve.</p>
<p>You may not be the winner the very first time, but if you keep trying then you will be <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

The robots are miniature satellites called SPHERES, and the final tournament is aboard the International Space Station! The goal is to build critical engineering skills for U.S. students, such as problem solving, design thought process, operations training, and team work.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The May Coders and Designers of the month:<br />
Algorithm:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22862114&amp;tab=alg">nikollson</a><br />
Design:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=287614&amp;tab=des">argolite</a><br />
Development:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=11790647&amp;tab=dev">j3_guile</a><br />
Studio:  <a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=thinkcreeper">thinkcreeper</a></p>
<p>We got the chance to interview a few of them so enjoy.<span id="more-2451"></span></p>
<p>Algorithm:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22862114&amp;tab=alg">nikollson</a></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Algorithm problem in May and why?</strong><br />
My favorite problem was &#8220;TheNumbersWithLuckyLastDigit&#8221; from SRM504.5.</p>
<p>This problem was very good because there were various ways for coding.  There was the way to untie using sequence in the other which had a way to run 100*100 time of loop.</p>
<p>In addition, there were various ways.  So, on the next day of SRM504.5, I was able to argue about it with the friend of the school. I was very fun.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
I made a program and electronic equipment to display in a school festival recently.  In addition, I solve a past problems of TopCoder when interest in algorithms is strong.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new TopCoder member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
It is good to enjoy TopCoder to change daily boredom, but I think that it is more fun if you intend to try your limit, and to do.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, you will be feel growth.</p>
<p>Studio:  <a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=thinkcreeper">thinkcreeper</a></p>
<p><a href="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/dsc00839.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2452" src="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/dsc00839-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Studio contest in May and why?</strong><br />
InSPIRE Zero Robotics Website Storyboard<br />
They want to use a lot of color and I love this kind of spec very much!</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not designing, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
I love hanging out with my friends and with my girl especially. We do like to explore the town. try some food.  Then, I also help my mom to keep our house clean, feeding the pets (I have chicken and fish), and watering the flowers. I&#8217;m a house keeping man <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new Studio member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Read the spec carefully, find the references as much as possible, make your submission clean,orderly,and submit as much as you can!  Don&#8217;t forget to pray before and after you work, may God help you in everything you do.</p>

<em>saarixx and son</em></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Design contest in April and why?</strong><br />
My favorite one is TopCoder Commons Utility since this component is expected to be used by developers very often.</p>
<p>I hope it will make developers&#8217; work at least a little bit easier.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
Most of free time I am playing with my son. Also I like watching movies and can&#8217;t miss Formula-1 races shown on TV.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new TopCoder member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Recently TopCoder admins decided to dramatically limit the number of users who can see winning submissions.</p>
<p>This is very bad news especially for newbies. Thus I want to give an advice to TopCoder managers instead of the members.</p>
<p>Please introduce some new non-disclosure agreement or rules that will allow active TC designers and developers to share their experience by checking each other&#8217;s submissions. This will help all (and especially new) TopCoder members a lot.</p>
<p>Development:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=21932422&amp;tab=des">bugbuka</a></p>
<p><a href="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/guilin.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2329" src="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/guilin-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
<em>GuiLin is my home town, it is a very beautiful, small city in south China.</em></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Development contest in April and why?</strong><br />
&#8220;Hestia B2B Shopping Cart Spinner&#8221; was my favorite contest in Apil. This was a very hot contest, the historical performance of the other three competiors are better than me. I got second place which built up my self-confidence for the future contests.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
I have routine work. i use my spare time to compete at TopCoder</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new TopCoder member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Very hot contests here.</p>
<p>Studio:  <a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=iamtong">iamtong</a></p>
<p><a href="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/iamtong.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2330" src="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/iamtong-300x248.png" alt="" width="300" height="248" /></a><br />
<em>iamtong&#8217;s daughter who will be competing on Studio in no time!</em></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Studio contest in April and why?</strong><br />
OAS Acquisition Game &#8211; Android Storyboard.  It was something new, challenging, and tough for me, the spec was also open to all creativities and I had a good time designing this.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not designing, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
My mischievous daughter <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new Studio member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Pay attention to studio rules, read contest spec carefully, ask questions, submit as early as possible, and keep submitting!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Given all the talk about  the importance of creativity and innovation to the U.S. economy, it’s amazing how little we know about the performance of creative people. How do you get the most out of people who are so often misunderstood as misfits and flakes? Starting with the basics: Do creative people work better in teams or all alone? And is it better to have creative teams competing with each other or all trying to help each other out?  Read full article <a href="http://www.bnet.com/blog/business-research/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-creative-people/1511">here</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-2316"></span></p>
<p>Kevin J. Boudreau and Karim R. Lakhani, both of Harvard Business School, have come up with a very simple answer, based on an experiment using the same interface as TopCoder, a Web site where programmers compete to write software and algorithms solving real-world problems. The <a href="http://www.nber.org/chapters/c12366.pdf">research</a> suggests that creative people know very well how they work best, and will perform nearly twice as well if managers simply let them choose their own work environments.</p>
<p><strong>Measuring Creativity</strong><br />
The experiment involved more than 500 computer programmers, each of whom had a TopCoder ranking. Each programmer was paired with the programmer closest to their ability level. In each pair, one person was asked how they preferred to work: Alone, competing against 19 other people, or as part of a five-person team. The programmers were split almost evenly in their preferences. The second programmer in that pair was given the same work environment as the first person. The result is two equally-talented groups of programmers. The only salient difference between them is that one group is working in an environment of their choice, while the other group has had their work environment decided for them. Some of the participants were eligible for cash prizes, while others were not.</p>
<p>Participants then spent 10 days working on a problem for NASA. They were to write an algorithm that, given restrictions around size, weight, and versatility, would determine the optimal components of the space medical kit included in NASA missions. The winning algorithm is now in use on all NASA missions. Each programmer’s algorithm was tested against 10,000 scenarios from NASA’s database of 200,000 scenarios, and then assigned a numerical score based on how well it performed.</p>
<p><strong>Teams vs. Individuals</strong><br />
The results underscore how important it is to let team players play on a team and to let loners alone:</p>
<ul>
<li>The programmers who got to choose how they worked produced algorithms that scored, on average, 83 percent higher than those who could not choose. That’s about the same improvement as the researchers got by offering a $1,000 cash prize.</li>
<li>Programmers who got to choose their work environment worked harder. The researchers measured this by counting the number of algorithms the programmer submitted. Programmers often submit more than one version of an algorithm, since there is no cost to doing so and having each version ‘scored’ provides valuable feedback.</li>
<li>Those who got to choose their work environment worked longer. Without a cash prize, those who got to choose their work environment spent about seven more hours working that those who did not get to choose. If there was a cash prize, those who were in the work environment of their choice put in almost 11 more hours than those who had the choice made for them. The fact that folks who got to choose how they worked put in more hours accounts for almost all of the difference in their performance compared to that of their peers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you think these results apply to all creative people, or just to programmers? How important is your work environment to your performance?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of TopCoder’s clients is a world-leading agri-business that focuses on bringing plant potential to life.  They have partnered with TopCoder on Marathon Match 70 – RestrictionDigest – which has just begun with $10,000 in prizes!</p>
<p>When a scientist wants to analyze a DNA molecule, they perform a procedure called restriction digest.  It uses a set of enzymes which cut the molecule into a certain set of DNA fragments according to certain rules.  In this problem, you will be given a DNA molecule and your task will be to construct a set of enzymes which have been applied to the molecule to produce a set of DNA fragments which satisfy the given restrictions.</p>
<p>The match is now open and will run for 3 weeks.  Read more <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MatchDetails&amp;rd=14525">here</a>.</p>

<a href="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/pic.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2275" src="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/pic-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Algorithm problem in January and why?</strong><br />
SRM 495  CarrotBoxes.   You had to think hard and code carefully but still there is a unique way of coding with Petr&#8217;s solution.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
I remember I competed in almost all SRMs in 2010 until now, except SRM 461 as the network was not available.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve competed in SRMs for more than  3 years.  I remember the SRMs I missed was less than 5.<br />
I competed even though I am very busy, but  I have to miss some SRMs because of  exam, course, or network.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new TopCoder member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Keep competing, code more and, read more.  When I competed at TopCoder, I didn&#8217;t even know A+B because I am not OIer, ACMer.  But after my first SRM, I was really attracted by TopCoder.  I kept competing and practicing till now.  I have seen a lot of excellent code, and learned so much.<br />
Now I&#8217;ve started writing a blog to share what I have learned.  I have a lot of friends, who are OIer or ACMer.  I believe anyone can be better if you persist and you are not alone.</p>
<p><strong>Design:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=21221008">BLE</a></strong><br />
<a href="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ble.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2265" src="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ble-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Design contest in January and why?</strong><br />
Hera Auto Dealer Network Partner Dealer Quote Web Service. This design gave me a chance to improve my design experience by addtional design enhancements.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
Reading and sports. When I am not competing, I like to read at home or run in the gym.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new TopCoder member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Never give up and you can get more than what you expect.</p>
<p><strong>Development:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22698875">flexme</a></strong><br />
<a href="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/img364955.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2266" src="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/img364955-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
<em>The University flexme graduated from.</em></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Development contest in January and why?</strong><br />
The contest I like most is &#8220;Online Review Update Review Management Topcoder web site assembly&#8221; because the payment was so attractive and this contest<br />
was not hard for me. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
Working at laboratory, reading books, watching &#8220;The Big Bang Theory&#8221; and sleeping. I like sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new TopCoder member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Be responsible for the code you write.</p>
<p><strong>Studio:  <a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=ngraphics">ngraphics</a></strong><br />
<a href="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2269" src="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
<em>Here is ngraphics going on a hike.</em></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Studio contest in March and why?</strong><br />
TCO11 Promotional Banner Contest because now I feel I gave a small contribution to TCO11.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not designing, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
My daily schedule 10:00AM to 7:00PM office then 10PM to 2:30AM is my Designing time for Studio. I know it’s very hard for me but I never give up, try and try…</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new Studio member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Before starting a new journey please read <a href="http://community.topcoder.com/studio/what-is-studio/">New Member Guide</a> carefully, read the contest specification carefully and follow the Contest Forums.  If you have any confusion, ask the admins because they are ready to help you always and most important keep hard working and never give up, some great people says that “Do not Count What You Have Lost, just see What You Have Now, Because Past Never Comes Back but Sometimes Future Can Give You Back Your Lost Things….</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&amp;threadID=690951">CxC</a> takes another step forward…</p>
<p>NoNameSite.com launched on February 28 (with special effort from <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=151743">Ghostar</a>, <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22503298">quesks</a>, <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=15763205">cyberjag</a>, and many others) .  With the site up and running, we are focusing our attention on developing the activities needed to keep it fresh and compelling.<span id="more-2255"></span></p>
<p>A crucial component of that pursuit is our community of Copilots.  Through the fall and early winter, the TopCoder Community provided some excellent ideas for games and other activities that would engage the interest of our target students.  We developed artwork around some of those ideas through Studio.  Studio really did its part – in many cases, the core ideas were re-themed with storylines and animation.  We now have a couple HTML5 renderings of these games that are just great.  While <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=151743">Ghostar</a> shepherds these games towards completion, we need new Copilots to help us complete the others.</p>
<p>Towards that end we recently posted several new Copilot positions.  These are just a beginning – we will be running new idea generation contests and those will generate new opportunities.</p>
<p>And these opportunities are a little different than what you might find on other projects.  The job here is not simply to follow the process and post successful contests – although that remains the baseline task – the job is to guide the TC Community in building a simply awesome activity.</p>
<p>At this point we have a few tools to help drive and measure this.  For example, our new custom UI Prototype scorecards require competitors to add features beyond the specification in order to gain full points.   To measure our target community’s response to our ideas, we are deploying a beta zone where CS-STEM members can try out prototypes and comment on them.  Rapidly-built prototypes are crucial, as is incorporating change and chaos.  Use these tools, and suggest new ones, to guide the process and TC community into innovating, developing and refining the best possible games and activities.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in trying your hand as a Copilot, we welcome you!  Prior CP experience a isn’t a factor.  You can sign up for one of our Copilot listings, and you can also contact bchops anytime with questions.</p>
<p>For more information on Copilot responsibilities, <a href="http://apps.topcoder.com/wiki/display/docs/CS-STEM+Game+CoPilot">this wiki</a> should prove useful.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to the DARPACS TC Network site for tips, suggestions and current thinking around CS-STEM Copilots.  You can find the site <a href="http://community.topcoder.com/darpacs/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Renat started his programming competition career in 2001, when he entered Perm State University. The next year he advanced to ACM ICPC North-Eastern European Regional Contest which was the last for me as a contestant and I had a grear honor to participate on one team with Renat. NEERC 2002 Champions were in our room and they solved all 9 problems in less than 4 hours, but we had only three accepted. Then the time of Renat had started and we then aplaced 14th with 6 solved problems. It is still the second best result for Perm State university teams ever and one of the NEERC best last hour result.</p>
<p>The next year, Renat’s team placed 6th at NEERC, advanced to ACM ICPC World Finals 2004, and remarkably placed 4th and won gold medals. After such a great success he had an audience with the President. Then at Petrozavodsk training camp he learned a lot about TopCoder SRMs and in a few years he became one of the most successful problemsolvers.</p>
<p>Renat inspired many programmers over the world. He shared his brilliant ideas everyday, making our skills stronger. The encouragement and support he gave all of us are the greatest gifts. Rest in peace.</p>
<p>Yuriy Aydarov (<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22689629">aydarov</a>)</p>
<p>It’s a pity. He really was a legend. When I was his teammate, I was always fascinated by how quickly he implemented solutions even for the most complex problems. It was always a pleasure to discuss programming problems with him, because he understood everything from a single word. He always agreed to search for a bugs in code and was able to quickly find it. When looking at code, he always was able to suggest a better way to write it. He taught me a lot, and because of him I became a red TopCoder. Renat is my idol.</p>
<p>Maybe things would have gone different, had he been more lucky after he stopped participating in ICPC. He was only 26.</p>
<p>Pavel Ponomarev (<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22228040">_pperm</a>)</p>
<p>Renat Mullakhanov. Actually, I wasn’t really close to him. I got to know him when I played for Perm SU #3 in my sophomore year. I rarely had a chance to talk to him, but when I did, it was a pleasure to discuss some programming problem with him. He was a good person. Talented and smart, too, no doubt. I was always fascinated by how he solved problems and placed in the top ten (or even won the contest). He seemed to be an ordinary guy from Perm, but look at what he had achieved! His success inspired me to compete for a spot in the finals. This proof that everything is possible empowered me to struggle for success in ICPC. Undoubtedly, it has influenced who I am now. I always looked up to Renat and was proud to know him.</p>
<p>I may never forget you, Renat, because for me you represent the fact that everything is possible. Because a small part of your success kindled a passion in me. I can’t imagine myself without this passion.</p>
<p>Thank you for who you were, Renat. Rest in peace.</p>
<p>Andrey Khlyzov (<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22630218">Kandyman</a>)</p>
<p>The Perm State University team, which Renat was a part of, won a gold medal at the ACM ICPC World Finals, and that was one of my reasons for entering PSU. We met in person when I was a freshman. Apart from being exceptionally talented, he was known for his modesty, tact and a great sense of humor. It was always a pleasure talking to him, because he was generous, friendly, and eager to share his ideas with you. Even though he was considerably better than me at programming, he never mentioned it when we discussed various problems. He always carefully proved his solutions and wasn’t afraid to admit it if he couldn’t come up with proof immediately. I remember him saying he was slightly disappointedly that he stopped proving his solutions rigorously after his ICPC days were over. I couldn’t understand then what he was upset over (he was a Topcoder target at the time), but now I realize that it was about intellectual honesty. Perhaps his success can be put down to this honesty. He studied in an ordinary Perm high school, and started doing programming contests only when he was a freshman. He managed to become a champion not having a strong programming school background.</p>
<p>Renat was a great man, a truly gifted person, and I will always remember him as he was: smart, talented and very modest. I’m sorry it had to be this way. Rest in peace, Renat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Prologue</strong></p>
<h5><strong></strong><em>Every millisecond matters to an Athlete. Every microsecond matters to a ruthlessly efficient TopCoder. </em></h5>
<p><span>I posted the following message to my friends on the Google Buzz social networking site on 20th June 2010</span></p>
<p><span>-</span>“<em>The Easy was a sitter. I was fuming with myself, as to why I took more than 10 minutes to code it. The Medium was a version of Euclid &#8211; I tried vainly to find an invariant for close to an hour &#8211; the result &#8211; the hard stayed unopened, the medium stayed un-submitted. The coding phase ended and I wiped a tinge of sweat off my brow.</em><span id="more-2130"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span> </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span>The intermission timer started counting down from 5:00. 4:35. Open Division Summary. 4:30. Scroll down. 936th place. 4:05. An extremely poor performance. 3:50. The top 800 qualify for round 2. 3:00. If it stays this way, my TopCoder open 2010, Algorithm Track was ending in another 15 minutes. 3:15. I was staring at the brink of elimination &#8211; 2:15 &#8211; hammered hard with my back to the wall. As the timer counted down and reached the final 10 seconds, some inner voice told me &#8211; &#8220;You are going to make it&#8221;. 10&#8230;9..8..7..6..5..4..3.2.1&#8230;the challenge phase began.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span> </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span>Sheer instinct. <span> </span>I opened a medium submission of a coder rated way below mine. What has he done? A while loop? X..Y&#8230;a couple of if&#8217;s&#8230;Instinct told me &#8211; &#8220;Check the bottom of the window&#8221; &#8211; I scrolled down. Aha&#8230;the number of lines &#8211; 103&#8230;&#8221;this is brute force!!!!!&#8221; a voice screamed inside the bottom of my eardrums &#8211; the code will fail for the maximum input limit. But I have to challenge it before anyone else could.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span> </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span>I pressed &#8220;challenge&#8221;. What was the maximum test case? Was it 10^6 or 10^7? I had no time to check the statement. Every microsecond could make a difference between going through or otherwise. I keyed in a random 5 9&#8242;s and pressed ok.&#8221;Confirm Challenge Arguments?&#8221; &#8211; said a pop-up. I said yes.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span> </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span>I felt the adrenaline rushing through the depths of my spine, as the TopCoder servers executed the test case. Did he implement some sort of short-circuit logic that terminated early? Was brute force the solution to this after all? Was I stupid enough not to try brute force in the first place? Am I going to get a -25.0 for a failed challenge? Am I going to get kicked out of the tournament? After a heart-stopping 120 seconds, the code timed out. With it, I bumped up my score by +50.0, jumped to 607th place, increased my rating by 100+, and, most importantly, qualified for TopCoder Open 2010 Algorithm Round 2 and lived to fight another day.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span> </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span>Drama, Excitement, Joy and Relief that only a TopCoder contest can bring.</span></em><span>”<em></em></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It was a pity that many of my friends could not understand the complete, inherent meaning of the post. But for TopCoder members like me, Single Round Matches have always been a way of life. </span></p>
<h3><span>The Beginning</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span><span> </span></span></span></em></strong><strong><em><span>“Throughout the centuries, there have always been men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own Vision” &#8211; </span></em></strong><strong><span>Ayn Rand<em></em></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>TopCoder was founded by Jack Hughes in late 2000, when there was an apparent lack of an objective rating system to quantify programming talent &#8211; something very crucial to the success of massive software projects. Jack had this vision of a world-wide community of programmers, working on problems designed by the community itself, writing code and building software &#8211; not because someone paid them to do so, but because it was designed to be fun and enjoyable.<span> </span>And that idea planted the seeds for what we know today as a “Single Round Match” or SRM. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The first event powered by TopCoder was the TopCoder Collegiate Challenge (TCCC) 2001, a multi-round programming contest aimed at universities in the United States. Even though a couple of rounds as part of that event already happened, the first match, officially baptized as <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=round_overview&amp;er=5&amp;rd=3000"><span style="color: #3366ff">SRM 1</span></a>, happened on 8th May 2001. Eighty one registrants made 194 submissions during the contest. The match was won by </span><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=109965"><span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong><span style="color: #ffcc99"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="color: #ffcc00">vulture</span></span></span></strong></span></a><span>, who remains as one of TopCoder’s earliest members. </span></p>
<h3><span>The Early Days</span></h3>
<p><span>The format of programmers solving algorithmic problems in a time-constrained environment was not totally new. ACM had been running annual programming contests across universities for many years before TopCoder came into being. But what made TopCoder’s format different was in not being able to see the results immediately. While that induced an element of suspense, the concept of a “<a href="http://apps.topcoder.com/wiki/display/tc/Algorithm+Overview"><span style="color: #3366ff">Challenge Phase</span></a>”, so unique to TopCoder, pitted one programmer against another in virtual 1-1 combat mode. Each programmer could see and challenge the code submitted by a competitor. If a challenge was successful, a +50 ensued. A successful defense ensured a -25. That made the concept of an SRM all the more intriguing. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>As a result, two things certainly happened in those summer months of 2001 &#8211; the good programmers who participated in the initial SRM’s came back for more. Secondly, they also began inviting their programmer-friends. The word started to spread. Soon, SRMs became THE place, where veterans hung out for some practice and where novices hung around for some advice. The TopCoder member community was growing and SRMs were pivotal to that growth. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>From an initial pool of a modest 18 people in January 2001, the member base grew to 1,900 registrants after the first few SRMs. With one match every week, there was no lack of competition or fun. The <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=round_overview&amp;er=5&amp;rd=4220"><span style="color: #3366ff">hundredth SRM</span></a> turned out only to be an eventuality and happened in due course on 24th June 2002. While all this was happening, equal importance and focus was also given to the two multiple-round tournaments &#8211; <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=tournaments&amp;d2=tccc01&amp;d3=summary"><span style="color: #3366ff">TCCC 2001</span></a> and <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=tournaments&amp;d2=tccc02&amp;d3=champ"><span style="color: #3366ff">TCCC 2002</span></a>. This ensured good word-of-mouth and a steady stream of new incoming members.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>By September 2002, fifteen months, two tournaments, and more than 100 SRMs later — the TopCoder member community passed 20,000 members.</span></p>
<h3><span>The Golden Years and The Purple Patch</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In many ways, the years from 2003 to 2007 were perhaps the golden years for TopCoder members, at least in terms of the number of SRMs organized, both stand-alone and as part of other tournament events. It was in 2003 that the TopCoder Invitational was rechristened as the <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=tournaments&amp;d2=tco03&amp;d3=tco03_overview"><span style="color: #3366ff">TopCoder Open 2003</span></a>, a name that stuck from then on. That, combined with the TCCC in spring, and along with one SRM every week, gave more than enough reasons for programmers to battle it out. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span>With more contests, the TopCoder rating system and the processes to recognize coders involved in malpractices evolved. That led to an increase in trust among the member community. More contests also meant TopCoder gained more expertise in all aspects of contest administration from problem set preparation and test case generation to general run-time administration. It was that expertise which led to TopCoder powering the <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/pl/?&amp;module=Static&amp;d1=google&amp;d2=google_overview"><span style="color: #3366ff">Google Code Jam</span></a>, an annual programming contest sponsored by Google, for 4 years from 2003-2006. And yes, every contest as part of Google Code Jam followed the exact same format as the SRMs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=round_overview&amp;er=5&amp;rd=5075"><span style="color: #3366ff">SRM 200</span></a>, in due course, happened on June 21st, 2004 and saw a comparatively huge turnout, with a chance for members to participate, get lucky and win some TopCoder goodies. Four hundred and twenty-one registrants made 650 submissions across both divisions. An average Division II problem set and a difficult Division I set awaited the coders. The Division I set turned out to be much harder eventually, due to system test issues. Yet, no one could prevent </span><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=272072"><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>SnapDragon</strong></span></a><span> from winning. He solved all three problems and had a successful challenge on the 250. </span><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=8355516"><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Eryx</strong></span></a><span>, (whose most recent match incidentally was <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=round_overview&amp;er=5&amp;rd=14423"><span style="color: #3366ff">SRM 494</span></a>), was the only other person to solve the hard and was there to claim second place with a failed medium. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>2004 was also the year when a developer, known by his handle, “<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=7267401"><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong><span style="color: #ff9900">TheFaxman</span></strong></span></a>”, was hired by TopCoder. It was only a matter of time, before TheFaxman, got involved in contest administration. TheFaxman interacted extensively with the TopCoder community, receiving feedback and fine-tuning the processes behind the scenes. Over the course of the next four years, TheFaxman ended up leading the administration team for more than 300 contests, close to half the number of contests TopCoder had ever conducted. While the member community does appreciate the role of everyone behind the scenes, TheFaxman was special and his departure in early 2008 was met with a collective echo of sadness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The relentless march of SRMs and along with it, the growth of the TopCoder member base continued. From 20,000 in 2003, it took a little longer than two additional years before the member base hit 50,000, in January 2005. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In March of the same year, <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=round_overview&amp;er=5&amp;rd=6534"><span style="color: #3366ff">SRM 235</span></a> happened; this SRM turned out to be significant, not because it was a milestone for TopCoder, but it was the first SRM, for a very special TopCoder member, a member whose rating graph stands tall to this day as the envy of every TopCoder. <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=round_overview&amp;er=5&amp;rd=6534"><span style="color: #3366ff">SRM 235</span></a> was the only match in which this particular coder competed in Division II. Needless to say, winning that Division II match turned out to be a mere formality. Starting with <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=round_overview&amp;er=5&amp;rd=6534"><span style="color: #3366ff">SRM 235</span></a>, (his most recent event being <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=round_overview&amp;er=5&amp;rd=14426"><span style="color: #3366ff">SRM 497</span></a>, and he won that too), his prolific performance at one point of time caused TopCoder to revise their member rating and ranking algorithm. Today, the word, “newcomer” next to his name might sound downright ludicrous. Yet, the following snippet, was written as part of the <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=round_overview&amp;er=5&amp;rd=6534"><span style="color: #3366ff">SRM 235</span></a> post match editorial &#8211; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><em><span>“In Division II, newcomer <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">Petr</span></strong></span> dominated the division by being the only one to solve all three problems and picking up two successful challenges as well”</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span> </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The next milestone, <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=round_overview&amp;er=5&amp;rd=9821"><span style="color: #3366ff">SRM 300</span></a>, conducted on 27th April 2006 and won by<strong><span style="color: #ff0000"> </span></strong></span><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=144400"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">tomek</span></strong></a><span>, happened more like an appointment kept with destiny, without much fanfare. The coder turnout was less than expected; the match also ended up being a low scoring affair with tough problem sets in both divisions. Later in the same year, in December 2006, the TopCoder member base reached the magical number of 100,000 members.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<h3><strong>The Recession and the trouble-some times</strong></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><strong><em><span>“TopCoder, the company exists to support TopCoder, the community”</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><strong><em><span><span> </span>- </span></em></strong><strong><span>Jack Hughes, TopCoder Founder</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Like every business in the world, TopCoder also suffered from the impacts of the financial crunch that hit the world economy in 2007-2008. TopCoder Founder Jack Hughes made a candid forum post titled “</span><a href="http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&amp;threadID=626354&amp;start=0"><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="color: #3366ff">status</span></span></a><span>”, through which all TopCoder members came to know the real status of TopCoder, the company. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Various measures of cost cutting were being considered, including the inevitable question of reducing the number of SRMs.<span> </span>This made the then ranked number one, </span><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10574855"><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Petr</strong></span></a><span> make a forum post titled “</span><a href="http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&amp;threadID=627571&amp;start=0"><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="color: #3366ff">S</span></span><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="color: #3366ff">RM Plans</span></span></a><span>”. Perhaps, the final few lines of <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10574855"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">Petr</span></strong></a>’s post echoed the emotions of a majority of the TopCoder member community, </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>“<em>I &#8216;m very grateful for what you do for us, and I&#8217;ll participate in as many SRMs as you can offer, and I&#8217;m not writing this post to complain. I&#8217;m writing it so that you know how grateful people are for you running SRMs, and that there&#8217;s a tiny hope that maybe making less SRMs is not the best decision for us addicts as well as for TopCoder the company</em>”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Even though the thread spread sparked off some passionate discussions with varied viewpoints, TopCoder did make the inevitable, yet difficult decision &#8211; the number of SRMs per month were reduced to two.</span></p>
<h3><span>Member SRM’s</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>During the <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=tournaments&amp;d2=tco09&amp;d3=overview&amp;d4=overview"><span style="color: #3366ff">2009 TopCoder Open</span></a>, TopCoder Founder Jack Hughes addressed the finalists of the various competition tracks onsite. It was during that speech and the Q&amp;A that followed it, that the idea of an actual Member SRM was floated &#8211; an SRM that is run fully based on volunteer work from the member community with minimal organizational/financial support from TopCoder.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Within months of the announcement, on the 18th of August 2009, the <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=round_overview&amp;er=5&amp;rd=13935"><span style="color: #3366ff">first Member Beta SRM</span></a> happened. This was the first such SRM, where TopCoder did not compensate monetarily the problem writers and testers &#8211; people involved in an SRM behind the scenes. Encouraged by that result and with adequate support from the member community, a plan was put forward to have 2 regular SRMs and 1 member SRM every month. The member SRMs were no different from the regular SRMs &#8211; considerable credit for which must go to all organizers – it’s just the members and TopCoder, collectively putting their best foot forward to keep the SRM tradition alive, despite the recessionary times. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Since then, 12 rated Member SRMs have happened. Even though 12/500 is a pretty small fraction, the move towards this concept of a Member SRM was significant. Right now, with weeks to go before the 500th SRM, it is necessary to recall the writers and testers involved in all Member SRMs.<span> </span>Here is a list &#8211; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Time is precious for everyone. These are the people who volunteered and gave the TopCoder community their time. And for that reason alone, it is necessary to appreciate, recognize and acknowledge the contributions of these members who made the Member SRMs possible.</span></p>
<h3><span>Musings of the Community</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Now, almost a full decade has passed since the first SRM. A natural question arises as to what role does an SRM play in the life of a TopCoder member? What is it about SRMs that makes a TopCoder member come back? Any article talking about the history of SRMs will be woefully incomplete without giving such a glimpse into the way TopCoder members perceive SRMs. After all, it is these members who make up the community; it is these members who compete in the SRMs. It is these members who design problems, write reference solutions and design test cases. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Posing these questions to and aggregating individual responses from a worldwide, distributed community can be problematic; yet, all of the above questions can be answered indirectly. Collected below are a few selected, entertaining musings, in no particular order, from the forum thread titled, “<span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&amp;threadID=181210"><span style="color: #3366ff">You know you are a TopCoder when..</span></a></span>” &#8211; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Although written with a subtle, almost infectious sense of humor, these and many such forum posts emphasize the emotional connect that TopCoder members share with an SRM. Perhaps, it is just this kind of involvement and dedication from both TopCoder members and staff alike, that have made SRMs what they are today.</span></p>
<h3><span>Looking Ahead</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Now, in 2011, ten years into its chequered history, the significance of SRMs to the TopCoder programming community is huge.<span> </span>Today, quoting your TopCoder algorithm rating percentile in your resume is encouraged; it might just give you that extra edge in an otherwise elusive job interview.<span> </span>There are people in your university who look up to you for inspiration after a good SRM performance. And perhaps, the biggest contribution of SRMs, beyond money, beyond fun, is that it has given programmers respect and recognition where it matters most &#8211; amongst other programmers.<span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>With every annual TopCoder open featuring more than 10 tracks of contests in the recent past, with strategic partnerships with NASA, PayPal and other organizations, TopCoder has come a long way from the days when SRMs used to be the only product on their portfolio. And all this started with the SRMs, which brought people to TopCoder and subsequently enticed them to compete in other tracks. For now, a “high five” to the TopCoder community and the TopCoder company for reaching the remarkable milestone of SRM 500. We definitely are optimistic and hope that the 1000th SRM comes up much before 2020. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Not as productive as applications or components competitions, not as magnificent as the TopCoder Open or TopCoder Collegiate Challenge, the Single Round Match is more like a quiet river which accompanies the whole history of TopCoder. It defines the culture of the community and the daily life of the members and witnesses the changes of the times in the TopCoder algorithm competition world. Open the historical scroll, and you will find all kinds of legendary stories of the kings, heroes, geniuses and people, and realize how time flies and what a great ‘world’ we are in.</p>
<p><span id="more-2136"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><strong><span>Year 2001</span></strong><strong><span lang="ZH-CN">（</span></strong><strong><span>SRM1-53</span></strong><strong><span lang="ZH-CN">）</span></strong><strong><span>The Ancient BIG 4</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span>The first SRM was born on May, 8<sup>th</sup>, 2001. Most competitors who didn’t experience that ancient age will envy those who did. Cash prizes were provided for each match and the frequency of matches was pretty high. You often had three chances to compete in a week, and in July 9 matches were provided in the single month. The problems looked pretty easy from the perspective of nowadays, but some were indeed pretty hard in that age. SRM 17 generated </span><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&amp;pm=117&amp;rd=3016"><span style="color: #3366ff">the first problem that was not solved by a single person in the competition</span></a><span>. </span>Some basic improvements to the rules were made in this age. From SRM 3 on, competitors were divided into 2 divisions so there wouldn’t be too much ability variance among the coders in the same room. This convention is still followed today. Starting with SRM 26, the challenge gain/punishment was changed from +100/-100 to +50/-50, which is a more reasonable amount that balances the relationships between coding and challenge, between ability and luck.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span>The world in that age was ruled by the ancient BIG 4. <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=114443"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">jonmac</span></strong></a>, the champion of the 2001 TopCoder Invitational, won 5 of the first 9 SRMs. <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=114853"><strong><span style="color: #ffff00">dmwright</span></strong></a> took 11 SRM wins through the whole year and <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=120816"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">malpt</span></strong></a> took 8. From SRM 39 to 41, <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=152073"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">NGBronson</span></strong></a> made the first 3 consecutive Division I SRM wins in our history. None of the BIG 4 compete nowadays, but their impressive performances in that age are still remembered by some veterans.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><strong><span>Year 2002</span></strong><strong><span lang="ZH-CN">（</span></strong><strong><span>SRM54-126</span></strong><strong><span lang="ZH-CN">）</span></strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=272072"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">SnapDragon</span></strong></a><strong>’s Rising</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span>The matches attracted more and more powerful coders across the world. SRM 65 is the first match in which the participants count passed 500. From SRM 67, the two divisions started using different problems, and that successfully solved the problem for those persons who thought the set was too easy or too hard. However, from SRM 102, TopCoder no longer provided cash prizes for competitors. The instant effect of that decision was greatly reflected in the declining participant count in the following several matches, but thanks to the more comfortable competition environment provided, competitors’ enthusiasm was restored quickly, and more importantly, the most addicted coders were not affected by this change too much.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span>Starting this year, the frequency of SRMs decreased to about one per week, but the participant count was increasing steadily. <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=269554"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">Yarin</span></strong></a> won 5 of the 6 matches from SRM 131-136, but that didn’t stop <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=272072"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">SnapDragon</span></strong></a> from consolidating his dominance.

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span>At the same time, the unprecedented internationalization trend of TopCoder can be directly reflected from SRM’s competitors/winners distribution.

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span>In the shadow of the global economic crisis, the frequency of SRMs dropped to two per month in this year. Needless to say, two is too few for algorithm competition geeks, so a new concept “Member SRM” was conceived at that time, to provide extra and flexible matches without putting too much economic pressure on the company.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The February coders and designers of the month have been picked and congratulations to:</p>

<p><strong>What was your favorite Algorithm problem in February and why?</strong><br />
FoxStones in SRM498 is my favorite problem. It needs no special knowledge. But I think,<br />
meet many problems for solving this problem.</p>
<p><strong>When you&#8217;re not competing at TopCoder, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
I practice programming with my friends in <a href="http://club.cyworld.com/ajouansi">algorithm club</a> at Ajou University.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new TopCoder member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
To meet a good mentor is very important. My mentor is libe. He introduced TopCoder to me,<br />
and taught coding know-how, algorithms, and what to know all about.</p>
<p>If you want to meet someone like him, observe your neighborhood. You will meet your mentor in the<br />
near future.</p>
<p><strong>Design:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=21932422">saarixx</a></strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=21932422"><br />
</a><a href="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/saarixx_with_son_working.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2152" src="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/saarixx_with_son_working-300x202.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="202" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Design contest in February and why?</strong><br />
February was a very quiet month in the design track, so I have not so many contests to choose from. I competed in the design contests for all components from Hera Auto Dealer Network Partner architecture during 5 days. I liked it since doing a lot of work during such limited period of time is always challenging. And in such cases you always need to correctly distribute your work time among all the active contests not to fail any of them.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
I try to spend a free time with my family, especially with my 3-month old son. If my son falls asleep for a while, I can watch one of my favorite TV series: The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Man, Chuck, Desperate Housewives, Futurama or Simpsons.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new TopCoder member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Very often I receive messages from TopCoder members asking to show them some document or article that will allow them to win design competitions as I do. Sure, I answer that such document doesn&#8217;t exist and the best way to start is to check existing components from the catalog and to begin competing in the competitions. I want to make clear for new TopCoder members that a lot of TopCoder rules and standards really exists. And knowing them really can make you win almost any design competition. But the problem is that these rules are not written anywhere. They are hidden in the minds of TopCoder community members who review submissions. Don&#8217;t waste your time by contacting these members and asking them to share all their secrets.</p>
<p>The rules they keep in mind cost a lot since they are a result of huge experience. So don&#8217;t expect to easily get all the secrets from someone that will allow you to become one of the best designers at once.</p>
<p>Instead you have a clear way to make other members share their experience with you &#8211; try to submit something and you will get their feedback as review comments. Then you need just to systematize all the comments, and not to make the same mistakes twice. This approach will allow you for sure to become one of the best designers. Go ahead and good luck!</p>
<p><strong>Development: <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=15604762">Yeung</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Development contest in February and why?</strong><br />
Hera series. Why? I am .Net guy. Less .Net contests except Hera in Feb.  When I found out I am coder of month in Feb, it surprised me.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
Movies, Travel, and Sleep. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new TopCoder member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Failure is the mother of success.</p>
<p>And to some new members, please open your contact link when you contact other people. Or leave your reply address in contact message.</p>
<p><strong>Studio:  <a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=systic">systic</a></strong><a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=systic"><br />
</a><br />
<a href="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/tc1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2155" src="http://community.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/tc1-300x197.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Studio contest in February and why?</strong><br />
Favorite contest was Tree Auto MyTree Business Center Wireframe because almost all the submissions were looking perfect and had no idea that i would win.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not designing, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
I play games, read, sleep, dream about my future <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  ..etc.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new Studio member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Never lose hope if you lose a contest&#8230;.Keep submitting the good work&#8230;one day your work will be recognized!</p>

<p><em><strong>To mark SRM 500, we asked members of our community to provide a retrospective on the ten year history of Single Round Matches – the timelines, people and events that over the years have made SRMs such an important part of so many members’ lives. Here is the first in a four part series of member-written articles.  Enjoy!</strong></em></p>

<em>TopCoder Member</em></div>
<h3>Here be dragons</h3>
<p>I remember how nervous I was during my first Single Round Match. The breeze of a late summer day came in through my open window, and I could hear the shouts from a football game across the street. I was inside my dorm room, staring at green and white characters scrolling down a black background. It reminded me of the Matrix movies, but I wasn&#8217;t Keanu Reeves and I didn&#8217;t feel ready for battle. I was trying to keep myself from rocking back and forth in my chair. I wanted my fingers to stop trembling so that I could start to peck out some code on the keyboard.<span id="more-2074"></span></p>
<p>Two weeks later when I took part in my second SRM, I had a bad case of nerves again. It wasn&#8217;t until I had a dozen SRMs behind me that I could calmly read through the problem statement and begin typing with a steady hand. I find it difficult to explain to people who don&#8217;t take part in algorithmic programming competitions why I was ever so nervous. When I take part in an SRM, I am nearly anonymous. I am represented by a brief string of characters on a computer screen. I rank near the bottom of Division 1, and no one is all that interested in how well I do. I am the opposite of someone like<strong> </strong><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=272072"><span style="color: #ff0000">SnapDragon</span></a></strong></span><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>In the fall of 2002, <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=272072"><span style="color: #ff0000">SnapDragon</span></a></strong></span> was a recent graduate of the University of Waterloo, where I was a grad student. He worked at a bioinformatics firm during the day and came to the university two or three nights a week to help train the school&#8217;s ACM programming team. I first saw him at a workstation in my lab during a practice contest. His name was at the top of the scoreboard, comfortably ahead of all the teams from Waterloo and elsewhere. I asked the coach how often a solitary <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=272072"><span style="color: #ff0000">SnapDragon</span></a></strong></span> was able to beat the three-person teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost always,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>I marveled at the sight and the sound of <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=272072"><span style="color: #ff0000">SnapDragon</span></a></strong></span> attacking the keyboard. He hammered away at the keys like a concert pianist performing one of Beethoven&#8217;s more frenzied passages, but the noise was like that of a machine gun. On his screen, the text cursor was churning out dense blocks of cryptic code, seemingly all brackets and single-letter variable names. It was nothing like any code I had ever written. I had seen <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=272072"><span style="color: #ff0000">SnapDragon</span></a></strong></span>&#8216;s name at the head of the TopCoder rankings, but that was my first glimpse of a top coder in action.</p>
<p>Later that winter I had a memorable conversation with <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=272072"><span style="color: #ff0000">SnapDragon</span></a></strong></span> after a training session. Fueled by countless cans of soda from the lab fridge, we talked into the early morning hours about programming competitions and about computer gaming, his other great passion. He owned all the major game consoles and played them for hours every day. I asked him if gaming didn&#8217;t interfere with his programming pursuits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Games actually make you smarter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But they also make you lazier.&#8221;</p>
<p>We discussed how the Arena compared to other types of programming contests. He said that one of the virtues of TopCoder&#8217;s format was how rigorously the problem constraints were specified. And then there was the cash to be made from SRMs. <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=272072"><span style="color: #ff0000">SnapDragon</span></a></strong></span> told me that for a while he was winning hundreds of dollars a week in the Arena, which was pretty sweet for a few hours of playful problem solving.</p>
<p>The financial picture for TopCoder and for the world was very different then. It was two years since the dot-com bubble had burst, and the tech industry was on an upswing. Web 2.0 was on its way. Silicon Valley was hiring at a rapid pace. TopCoder was busy marketing its employment services to companies looking for the kind of programmers who excelled at algorithm contests. Sponsors funded two SRMs a week, with substantial cash prizes for top placements in each room of the Arena.</p>
<p>As TopCoder diversified its activities from recruitment to software development, the algorithm competitions diminished in frequency and in financial reward. SRMs were no longer very lucrative, yet they remained a vital fixture on the TopCoder calendar, and the Arena grew as a gathering place for algorithmic problem solvers from around the world.</p>
<h3>From the Arena to the workplace</h3>
<p>A member whose name I recognized without having met him was <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=277659"><span style="color: #ff0000">radeye</span></a></strong></span>, who participated in SRMs frequently from 2002 to 2005. I knew of him from the LaTeX software stack, which is used throughout the academic world to typeset technical papers. Because <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=277659"><span style="color: #ff0000">radeye</span></a></strong></span> is the author of dvips, the popular DVI-to-PostScript compiler, I had seen his name many times on the command line while preparing documents for printing.</p>
<p>I wrote to him recently to ask why his participation in SRMs has been so sparse compared to earlier years.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cash prizes provided a significant incentive to compete,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;But primarily, I&#8217;ve been too distracted by other pursuits.&#8221;</p>
<p>His recent exploits in recreational programming include an exhaustive exploration of the states of the Rubik&#8217;s Cube, showing that it can always be solved in <a href="http://cube20.org/"><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>twenty moves or less</strong></span></a>. There is plenty to occupy <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=277659"><span style="color: #ff0000">radeye</span></a></strong></span>, but he still competes on TopCoder occasionally, and he holds the quality of SRMs in high regard.</p>
<p>&#8220;TopCoder provides excellent, well-tested problems,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I believe they do a better job of this than anyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although he has never competed in TopCoder&#8217;s software design and development contests, <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=277659"><span style="color: #ff0000">radeye</span></a></strong></span> has applied lessons from algorithmic programming competitions to real-life software projects. He says that he has applied &#8220;tools, tricks and APIs [that he has] learned from other competitors&#8221; in his own work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know TopCoder has improved my programming,&#8221; says <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=277659"><span style="color: #ff0000">radeye</span></a></strong></span>.</p>
<p>I recently asked <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=260987"><span style="color: #ff0000">dangelo</span></a></strong></span>, another elite competitor in the early years of TopCoder, about the correlation between success in algorithm contests and proficiency in software engineering. From 2002 to 2005, <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=260987"><span style="color: #ff0000">dangelo</span></a></strong></span> competed in 77 TopCoder matches as a way of spending &#8220;a lot of extra energy that wasn&#8217;t being taken up by [his] coursework at Caltech.&#8221; Today <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=260987"><span style="color: #ff0000">dangelo</span></a></strong></span> is a well-known Silicon Valley entrepreneur. He was the Chief Technology Officer of Facebook before leaving to found <a href="http://www.quora.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>Quora</strong></span></a>, a social question-and-answer website.</p>
<p>In <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=260987"><span style="color: #ff0000">dangelo</span></a></strong></span>&#8216;s experience, the ability to work with large data sets at an Internet company depends on many factors, &#8220;including writing good code, reading code, building good abstractions, systems knowledge, applying and designing algorithms, documentation and communication, experience and working hard,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Programming contests mainly build skill at applying and designing algorithms quickly,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;As an engineer, having this background can be a big advantage, but the other skills are equally important and need to be developed.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=260987"><span style="color: #ff0000">dangelo</span></a></strong></span> if he could recall specific cases where he had applied something he had learned in algorithmic programming competitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;This happens all the time,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>While <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=260987"><span style="color: #ff0000">dangelo</span></a></strong></span> was coding the first version of Quora, these were some of the challenges in which his competition background helped him: &#8220;Designing the data structures and algorithms for our question search service. Writing the algorithm to compute the difference between two rich text blocks (after someone edits an answer or other content). Structuring the abstraction for some of our real-time update infrastructure. Optimizing various parts of our code that operate on large datasets.&#8221;</p>
<p>So if you come across people who believe that the mathematical tricks and puzzles we encounter in SRMs are divorced from the realities of software engineering, you can tell them to think again.</p>
<h3>The crème de la crème</h3>
<p>The Arena is just one of many venues for algorithmic competition while you&#8217;re a student. There are the USACO and IOI contests in high school, and university undergraduates can take part in ACM competitions at the local, regional, and global levels. Of course you can compete in SRMs at the same time, as many collegiate competitors do.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve graduated out of the realm of ACM competition, the Arena is still there for you. TopCoder functions as the major league of the competitive programming world. This was underlined recently in the final online round of the Facebook Hacker Cup, an algorithmic programming contest that was open to everyone on Facebook. All 25 of the top 25 finishers were TopCoder members, two of them rated yellow and the rest rated red.</p>
<p>Red is the highest color in TopCoder&#8217;s rating rainbow. At the top of that narrow red band are the brightest stars in the coding firmament. Like in any sports league, there is a small group of phenomenal talents whose names are known to the masses. No two contestants are better known or more feared in the Arena than <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10574855"><span style="color: #ff0000">Petr</span></a></strong></span> and <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=19849563"><span style="color: #ff0000">ACRush</span></a></strong></span>.</p>
<p>Upon his debut in March 2005, <span style="color: #ff0000"><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10574855"><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Petr</strong></span> </a></span>spent a single round as a yellow-rated coder before zooming up to red. At the time I am writing this, just after SRM 498, over 85% of his Level Three solutions have passed the system tests. Those are the hardest problems on TopCoder. His passing rates on the Level Two and Level One problems are 93% and 96% respectively. Close to perfect: that&#8217;s the level of performance it has taken <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10574855"><span style="color: #ff0000">Petr</span></a></strong></span> to rank number one in 136 of his last 230 rounds (not adjusted for unrated matches).</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=19849563"><span style="color: #ff0000">ACRush</span></a></strong></span> took part in his first SRM eight months after <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10574855"><span style="color: #ff0000">Petr</span></a></strong></span>, and rocketed on a similarly steep trajectory toward the peak of the algorithm charts. He has held the top spot 30 times out of the 79 rounds since he first became number one. <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=19849563"><span style="color: #ff0000">ACRush</span></a></strong></span> and <strong><span style="color: #ff0000"><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10574855"><span style="color: #ff0000">Petr</span></a></span> </strong>have reached similar heights of success along quite different paths. <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10574855"><span style="color: #ff0000">Petr</span></a></strong></span>&#8216;s ACM teams took second place at the World Finals on two occasions, whereas <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=19849563"><span style="color: #ff0000">ACRush</span></a></strong></span> has won the TopCoder Open and the Google Code Jam. And they have very distinct coding styles;<span style="color: #ff0000"> <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=19849563"><span style="color: #ff0000">ACRush</span></a></strong></span></span>&#8216;s solutions tend to be more compact and more arcane than <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10574855"><span style="color: #ff0000">Petr</span></a></strong></span>&#8216;s.</p>
<p>These two formidable competitors may dispute the mastery of the Arena, yet they have nothing but warm words for each other. When I contacted <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=19849563"><span style="color: #ff0000">ACRush</span></a></strong></span> recently, he said that he was &#8220;very happy&#8221; to have Petr as a rival and that he never worries about how their rankings compare to each other.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=19849563"><span style="color: #ff0000">ACRush</span></a></strong></span> says that he normally practices about five hours a week. Before a major tournament like the TopCoder Open, he will buckle down for about 30 hours of extra training. Despite the hours of preparation, <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=19849563"><span style="color: #ff0000">ACRush</span></a></strong></span> likes to emphasize the recreational aspect of the TopCoder Arena.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SRM is the favorite game in my life,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=19849563"><span style="color: #ff0000">ACRush</span></a></strong></span> says that winning does not increase his enjoyment of an SRM. What counts for him is the quality of the problems. It&#8217;s &#8220;more fun if we have a nice problem set,&#8221; he says.</p>
<h3>Life in the trenches</h3>
<p>Despite the competitive nature of SRMs, they are not elitist events. Coders in all echelons take part in them with great enthusiasm. Surely one of the most dedicated Arena warriors is <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=21684580"><span style="color: #ff0000">dcp</span></a></strong></span>, who has completed 201 matches since his debut in April 2006. His rating color remained gray, the lowest in the TopCoder spectrum, until January 2007. It took 137 rounds before <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=21684580"><span style="color: #ff0000">dcp</span></a></strong></span> broke into Division 1 in April 2009, three years after his first SRM.</p>
<p>What has enabled <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=21684580"><span style="color: #ff0000">dcp</span></a></strong></span> to persevere? He told me recently that he tries to avoid setting goals of a kind where he can&#8217;t control the outcome, such as earning a yellow rating or placing in the top 50 in an SRM.</p>
<p>&#8220;I prefer to set goals that I have control over,&#8221; says <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=21684580"><span style="color: #ff0000">dcp</span></a></strong></span>. &#8220;I might set a goal to solve 5 or 6 problems in a week. Those types of goals are totally in my control, because either I put the time into it or I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spends about three or four hours a week practicing for SRMs. Like <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=19849563"><span style="color: #ff0000">ACRush</span></a></strong></span>, he puts great emphasis on the fun factor.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as you enjoy competing in SRMs, then that&#8217;s what really counts,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about the rating too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike most of the passionate algorithm competitors, <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=21684580"><span style="color: #ff0000">dcp</span></a></strong></span> is also active in TopCoder&#8217;s component competitions, which award healthy cash prizes to the winners. Although SRMs are not a source of income for him, <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=21684580"><span style="color: #ff0000">dcp</span></a></strong></span> finds them profoundly useful, saying that through them he has learned many things that he would not have learned otherwise. For example, by studying the code of elite problem solvers, he recently learned about the inclusion-exclusion principle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I enjoy the challenges and I like to learn new things,&#8221; says <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=21684580"><span style="color: #ff0000">dcp</span></a></strong></span>. &#8220;SRMs are like &#8216;mind exercise&#8217; for me, and it&#8217;s always exhilarating.&#8221;</p>
<p>How long can we keep at the game? Will SRMs always be worth doing? <span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=9958883"><span style="color: #ffcc00">Minilek</span></a></strong></span>, who started doing TopCoder in his third year of undergraduate studies at MIT and is now close to finishing his PhD there, says that he is optimistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think SRMs are still as fun as they were in the past, and I&#8217;m optimistic that they&#8217;ll stay that way for a while longer,&#8221; <span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=9958883"><span style="color: #ffcc00">Minilek</span></a></strong></span> says.</p>
<p>He is glad that the problems have gotten harder because his &#8220;ability has only improved over time and it&#8217;s fun to keep things challenging.&#8221; He does note that &#8220;it might make modern SRMs harder for a newcomer.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=9958883"><span style="color: #ffcc00">Minilek</span></a></strong></span> says that competitive programming used to be his &#8220;most enjoyable hobby&#8221; and is still among his favorite pastimes. It has also benefited him in job interviews.</p>
<p>&#8220;Interviewers liked to ask coding puzzle questions,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and after having played TopCoder a bit they all seemed easy.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=9958883"><span style="color: #ffcc00">Minile</span><span style="color: #ffcc00">k</span></a></strong> has completed 193 rounds in the Arena. In the course of the first 151 of those, he improved gradually from green to red. His enjoyment of SRMs has been essential to his progress. He says that it&#8217;s best not to force yourself to do something unless you find it enjoyable.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you enjoy what you&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he says, &#8220;you&#8217;ll do it a lot and naturally improve, and it won&#8217;t seem like work; it&#8217;ll feel like fun all along.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Behind the scenes</h3>
<p>What is the machinery that makes the fun happen? Who are the people responsible for creating those exhilarating SRM experiences? I turned to <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=303644"><span style="color: #ff0000">Olexiy</span></a></strong></span> for his perspective on the operations that take place in the basement (or perhaps the dungeon) of the Arena.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=303644"><span style="color: #ff0000">Olexiy</span></a></strong></span> was the head problem writer for TopCoder&#8217;s algorithm competitions from August 2005 until February 2009, when he handed the reins to <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10481120"><span style="color: #ff0000">ivan_metelsky</span></a></strong></span>. He has seen SRMs from both sides, having competed in them before and after his tenure as Algorithm Coordinator. <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=303644"><span style="color: #ff0000">Olexiy</span></a></strong></span> has been among the coders who ask the admins when the system tests are finally going to finish, and many times he has had that question asked of him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=303644"><span style="color: #ff0000">Olexiy</span></a></strong></span> started contributing problem sets before he became the head writer. He claims that his predecessor in the post, <span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=159052"><span style="color: #ffcc00">lbackstrom</span></a></strong></span>, wanted him to stop writing because one of his problem sets went &#8220;so terribly wrong.&#8221; But a few months later, when <span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=159052"><span style="color: #ffcc00">lbackstrom</span></a></strong></span> was in a pinch,<span style="color: #ff0000"> <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=303644"><span style="color: #ff0000">Olexiy</span></a></strong></span></span> happened to have some problems ready to go. His affairs continued so well that <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=303644"><span style="color: #ff0000">Olexiy</span></a></strong></span> rose to the chief position &#8220;about six months after being banned as a writer,&#8221; as he tells it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re one of the veteran algorithm competitors who feels that SRM problems have gotten harder over the years, <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=303644"><span style="color: #ff0000">Olexiy</span></a></strong></span> agrees with you.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest change [has been] the difficulty of the problems,&#8221; he said when I asked how SRMs have changed.</p>
<p>Sometimes a problem set is too tricky by accident, because the writer doesn&#8217;t see the challenges posed by his own problems. After all, he has &#8220;usually [spent] dozens of hours thinking about them.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=303644"><span style="color: #ff0000">Olexiy</span></a></strong></span> relates that when <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10574855"><span style="color: #ff0000">Petr</span></a></strong></span> wrote his second SRM, he was confident that the problems were quite easy and that there would be &#8220;at least 20 people with all three problems solved.&#8221; It turned out to be a massacre: &#8220;two coders had the medium and nobody came within a mile of the hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>But <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=303644"><span style="color: #ff0000">Olexiy</span></a></strong></span> points out that the SRMs have also had to become more challenging in order to meet the rising level of skill among the TopCoder membership. In <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=303644"><span style="color: #ff0000">Olexiy</span></a></strong></span>&#8216;s estimation, anyone ranked within the top 200 today would be able to breeze through the 2003 or 2004 TopCoder Open final problems in 45 minutes. He adds that the problem writers have tried to keep the difficulty of Division 2 &#8220;at the same level,&#8221; but that the difficulty of Division 1 has grown &#8220;tremendously.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I asked <span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=303644"><span style="color: #ff0000">Olexiy</span></a></strong></span> </span>about the highs and lows of running an SRM, he quoted <span style="color: #ff6600"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=7267401"><span style="color: #ff6600">TheFaxman</span></a></strong></span> on the experience of going through an Arena meltdown: &#8220;Being admin at such events is like skydiving, but without most of the fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>The greatest satisfaction that<span style="color: #ff0000"> <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=303644"><span style="color: #ff0000">Olexiy</span></a></strong></span></span> gets from an SRM is when someone likes a problem of his. After a highly ranked coder told him that &#8220;TakeBus was one of the best problems he had ever seen&#8221;,<span style="color: #ff0000"><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=303644"> </a><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=303644"><span style="color: #ff0000">Olexiy</span></a></strong></span></span> says, &#8220;I was truly happy.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The road ahead</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if happiness is the right word for what <span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=282718"><span style="color: #ffcc00">Rustyoldman</span></a></strong></span>, my favorite TopCoder curmudgeon, experiences in the Arena. He does say that SRMs are an important pastime of his: &#8220;If there is an SRM going on, everything else is dropped, except work and sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>He grumbles that &#8220;the participant base for SRMs has moved far away from my time zone.&#8221; Then he brightens at an idea: &#8220;I guess I could move to Europe in order to participate in TopCoder more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although I don&#8217;t believe <span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=282718"><span style="color: #ffcc00">Rustyoldman</span></a></strong></span>&#8216;s claim that he is 154 years old, he is certainly among the older cohort on TopCoder. &#8220;I try to get other old farts to do contests,&#8221; he told me, but &#8220;mostly they [say that] they don&#8217;t have the time.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=282718"><span style="color: #ffcc00">Rustyoldman</span></a></strong></span> takes a relaxed attitude toward training. He estimates that he spends an average of three hours a week helping to make problem sets for SRMs in which he is not competing, but &#8220;near zero hours per week preparing for participation.&#8221; He concedes, &#8220;Zero is probably too little.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I look back at my own history in SRMs, I can see several bouts of intensive participation separated by long spans of time in which I was a stranger to the Arena. At the start of this year I returned to regular SRM participation once again. What&#8217;s new for me this time is a clear sense of how my training in algorithmic problem solving has contributed to my abilities in software development. I&#8217;m convinced that the more time I devote to SRMs, the more efficiently I&#8217;ll be able to do my work.</p>
<p>In my recent correspondence with <span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=20701906"><span style="color: #ffcc00">Johan.de.Ruiter</span></a></strong></span>, who has competed in 96 rounds since 2006, I gained more insight into my relationship with the Arena. He describes the initial urge to compete in SRMs as an addiction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to compete in SRMs while sitting in the doorstep of the electrical closet,&#8221; he told me, &#8220;often at 3 o&#8217;clock in the morning. I didn&#8217;t have a longer cable, and I didn&#8217;t need sleep as much as I needed my fix of competitive algorithmic problem solving.&#8221;</p>
<p>SRMs took a back seat when <span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=20701906"><span style="color: #ffcc00">Johan.de.Ruiter</span></a></strong></span> became more involved in coaching his university&#8217;s ACM teams and in developing his <a href="http://puzzlepicnic.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>puzzle website</strong></span></a>, but he is eager to make a comeback in the TopCoder Arena.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recently I have found more time and I am still as excited about SRMs as I ever was,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I certainly hope to be a regular in the Arena once again in 2011.&#8221;</p>
<p>It struck home for me when<span style="color: #ffcc00"> <span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=20701906"><span style="color: #ffcc00">Johan.de.Ruiter</span></a></strong></span></span>, in describing his early experiences with the Arena, put it this way: &#8220;My rating became part of my identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The identification with my rating explains some of the anxiety I felt during my first few SRMs, and the pride I take today in my renewed participation. I know that my TopCoder algorithm rating doesn&#8217;t wholly define my programming abilities. Nonetheless, my capacity to solve algorithmic problems under pressure is a crucial part of my identity as a software developer. It is evidence of the time I have spent studying some of the deeper mysteries of my craft. My sole regret is that I&#8217;ve only taken part in about a quarter of the first five hundred SRMs. I am determined to improve my rate of participation, and my rating, over the next five hundred.</p>

<p><strong>Algorithm:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22877779">komaki</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/750px-tdai-ji_kon-d.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2056" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/750px-tdai-ji_kon-d-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></a><br />
<em>komaki&#8217;s home town.</em></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Algorithm problem in January and why?</strong><br />
KnightsOut in SRM494 is my favorite problem. It looks to have so many cells, which decide whether the board can be a solution, that I can&#8217;t use bitmap or other methods to solve it. But there is a miracle one. Even though everyone knows the method, it is hard to notice it. It is the reason why KnightsOut is my favorite problem.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
Watching anime and reading manga.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new TopCoder member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
I am not such a great coder now.</p>
<p><strong>Design:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=20437508">MiG-29</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/mig_29.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2057" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/mig_29-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
<em>MiG-29 with his daughters in one of numerous parks on St. Petersburg, Russia.</em></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Design contest in January and why?</strong><br />
All CS-STEM specifications and conceptualization contests were my favorites in January. Designing a new community for educating mid-high school students is a challenging and very interesting task.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
Taking care on family and children keeps me busy even when I am competing at TopCoder. In my free time I like to read books.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new TopCoder member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Please attend TCO&#8217;2011 &#8211; you have real chances to win a free trip to the on-site final rounds. Many of newcomers have won previous TCO trips from the first attempt.</p>
<p><strong>Studio:  <a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=selvia_ettine">selvia_ettine</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite Studio contest in January and why?</strong><br />
I&#8217;d say my favorite was TC Press-Room Redesign Wireframe.<br />
I&#8217;m usually not so good at managing pages that have many elements/content in them, but I got it right in this contest (finally!).  So, I&#8217;m very glad.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not designing, what keeps you busy?</strong><br />
I read, play video games, and sleep.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give some advice to a new Studio member, what would you share with them?</strong><br />
Make sure to submit at least 30 minutes before the deadline. Seriously, you don&#8217;t want to miss the deadline after all that hard work!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At TopCoder, we boast about having the best and brightest members from around the world as part of our community.</p>
<p>That is why we need your help.  If you have not heard, TopCoder has been engaged by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) to build a program that will attract students to topics in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, with an emphasis on Computer Science.  Learn more about that program <a href="http://topcoder.com/home/csstem/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Before we can do that, we need your ideas.  Right now we have an Idea Generation contest going on looking for game ideas.  We need cool, talented, and smart people like our TopCoder members to give us ideas that we can potentially build to be a part of this new site (which we&#8217;re calling NoNameSite.com).</p>
<p>Help us by taking your ideas and submitting them for this contest.  There will be 15 winners; the top five will win $300, and each of the top 15 will win a limited edition NoNameSite.com t-shirt.  Registration ends on December 17 at 17:00 UTC -5. Learn more about the contest <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProjectDetail&amp;pj=30016034">here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the October coders and designers of the month:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22767798">Algorithm: fushar</a><br />
<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=7340263">Design: gevak</a>, 8 first places and 4 second places<br />
<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22839410">Development: live_world</a>, 8 first places and 1 second place<br />
<a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=vcsenge">Studio: vcsenge</a> won $2,050<span id="more-3397"></span></p>
<p>TopCoder interviewed our winners so check it out!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22767798">Algorithm: fushar</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/me_wearing_batik.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1965" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/me_wearing_batik-228x300.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="300" /></a><br />
<em>Fushar (wearing Batik) when awarded his silver medal at IOI 2010, Canada.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
I think TopCoder SRMs are the most exciting online competitions. I learn alot of types of problems in SRMs and cool coding styles by looking at other people&#8217;s solutions.</p>
<p>I also meet new friends in the Arena chat room, and we often chat before SRM begins.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Last month I was struggling to move away from my shaky blue-yellow rating performance. I felt very happy when I was quite far from that rating boundary. My next project is working hard to reach the red rating <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>My team and I were also practicing a lot for the upcoming ICPC Asia Jakarta Regional Contest. It is our first year in university, and we would like to do well in our first ICPC regional.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
Probably no specific career or place. However, I always dream I could travel around the world as a good coder.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
I usually don&#8217;t eat while competing, but when I am out of ideas during the coding phase I like to drink some cold tea.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Playing table tennis with college friends and reading good puzzle books.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t believe in lucky charms. I usually take a bath minutes before the SRM to make my body and mind fresh, prepare pen and paper, and pray seconds before it starts.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
rng_58. I often read his solutions because his code is concise and elegant. The problemsets he wrote for SRMs were very nice, too. When I heard that he won the TCO Algorithm Final, I was very happy.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=7340263">Design: gevak</a></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ufa-state-technical-university-of-aviation.gif"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1966" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ufa-state-technical-university-of-aviation-300x225.gif" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
</strong><em>The university gevak graduated from.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
The pleasure to prove to myself that I can do it well and earn money using my head.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Definitely the TC direct update architecture, it was huge.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
Hard to say, my interests change very often, unfortunately I hardly can keep motivation for the same project for a long time.</p>
<p>For me, one of the largest advantages of TC freelancing is having new projects every week.</p>
<p>Four years ago the job of my dreams would be a TC algorithm coordinator. Nowadays I’m very happy with full-timing designs and architectures. It’s very exciting and allows to earn more if you work more.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
No, it takes too much effort, time and risk of damaging the laptop.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Between contests – eating and sleeping only <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Instead of contests – watching TV, movies, etc, having fun with friends, playing poker, in the summer – walking and sometimes playing football. I also like traveling and swimming (preferable in a warm clean sea).</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?</strong><br />
Nothing. Though I probably should find some since, IMO, I was unlucky in last DR.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
SnapDragon is awesome, I’ve learned his “doit()” and instantly became red. His code is an art <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Among designers, argolite is a brilliant example of professionalism and inhuman workability.</p>
<p>Hard to say about admins, didn’t worked with them very close, but what I’ve noticed and like<br />
is how WishingBone writes RS’s – they give quite a lot of freedom for designer and usually allow to make enhancements and get higher scores.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=vcsenge">Studio: vcsenge</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bp.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1967" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bp-300x197.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197" /></a><br />
<em>vcsenge&#8217;s favourite thing in Budapest is that they have a hill in the middle of the city.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from Studio competitions?</strong><br />
I can learn how to design something the client likes. It is really special in these competitions because usually in other competitions we need to design something really new, fresh, trendy, extreme&#8230; but matter of fact this is not what a simple, useable user interface should be. So through these competitions I have learned much about the clean, self-understanding, useable UIs &#8211; this is very useful in the case of every &#8220;real life project&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Collaboration Portal Design. I really like these competitions where we design something from nothing.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where  would you be working?</strong><br />
I would like to design new applications and services for mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while designing?</strong><br />
I usually forget to eat at all when working <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  but I drink tea all the time.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at Studio, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
I am still studying at the university, so it takes all my time. I can do TopCoder only in those few hours I can spare.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when designing?</strong><br />
My giant bear named Szörpamacs. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite Studio member or admin and why?</strong><br />
Jess (Jessica Williams) <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  She has helped me so many times&#8230; If I have any question she answers in a few minutes. I would like to thank her again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/bosphorus.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1914" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/bosphorus-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
TopCoder competitions help me to code as fast as possible and without bugs. I guess that is the major return.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Last month, we organized the Turkey Local Contest. There was an unsolved problem in the problem set, about Computational Geometry. That was one of the hardest problems I worked last month.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
As a career, after Master&#8217;s degree I plan to do PhD. After PhD, I would work in some &#8220;research and development company&#8221; related with my research area.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
During SRM&#8217;s, usually I don&#8217;t eat, but periodically I drink some water. I think, water is the best way to &#8216;refresh&#8217; the mind.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Going out with friends, playing tennis and soccer.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
My laptop <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
My favourite member is Vasyl[alphacom]. He had a great effort for our ACM training camp in Turkey, in June 2010. My &#8216;real&#8217; trainings for contests started after that camp. It was a pleasure to have such a trainer.</p>
<p>Moreover, as many of the TopCoder members do, I admire Petr. I hope that, someday I will have an oportunity to be his student.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22667317&amp;tab=des"><strong>Design:  tomaM</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/people-palace.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1915" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/people-palace-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
<em>People&#8217;s palace building. If you ever go to Bucharest you have to see it. It&#8217;s the 2nd largest building in the world by surface area. </em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
First it would be a lot of adrenalin and sometimes close to a heart attack when I see reviews. The rest is a nice combination of experience and money.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Studio Replatforming project. It had two modules and the second one was very large and required lots of research. Never read this much code in a week.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
I would be a presenter for a TV show like TopGear or racing team driver. I love cars, own and ride daily a Honda Shadow bike that I almost tear down into pieces and built it back up. Whenever I feel down, I just go for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
I find myself forgetting to eat while competing. Then the night falls and I have to chose between sleep and food. I usually chose sleep but the next morning I would eat 3 meals for breakfast.<br />
Drinking is another story, and I&#8217;m drinking various kinds of tea. I love tea and we have lots of flavors over here.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Riding my bike, hanging out with friends, reading a good book, listening to music. The usual.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t believe in lucky charms.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
I have lots of project managers that helped me over time. I also like the work copilots are doing now and I&#8217;ve worked well with Ghostar, Indemar and lmmortal. They&#8217;re very responsive and any issue you have with the projects they manage, they will get out of their way to help you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22748068&amp;tab=dev"><strong>Development:  utlovey</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=djackmania"><strong>Studio:  djackmania</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/photo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1918" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/photo-300x182.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="182" /></a><br />
<em>djackmania and family at Borobudur, the world heritage</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from Studio competitions?</strong><br />
upgraded skill and time management and off course the earned price</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I think the ipad project, since this is new to studio.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
an astronout and become a mayor of the moon <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while designing?</strong><br />
No meals while designing</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at Studio, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
playing with my kids</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when designing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
No ideas, my long hair? <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite Studio member or admin and why?</strong><br />
Jess, adam &amp; chris, because they have been taking care Studio until like now as a pleasant place to work.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congrats to the Coders and Designers for the month of August; Algorithm:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22751095">ir5</a>, Design:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10437190">caru</a>, Development:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22795218&amp;tab=dev">tmlshirley</a>, Studio:  <a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=iamtong">iamtong</a>.  TopCoder did some exclusive interviews with the winners, enjoy!<span id="more-3799"></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22751095">Algorithm: ir5</a><br />
</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2010-03-08-164052.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1849" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2010-03-08-164052-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
<em>This is the photo ir5 took at Kinkaku-ji(Temple of the Golden Pavilion), one of tourist spot in Kyoto (ir5&#8242;s hometown).</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
Of course, participating competitions will enhance my insight of math and algorithm, and also I enjoy them like on-line-game.</p>
<p>SRMs, where hundreds of people participate and compete at the same time, are exciting by itself, and I would be happy when I get good outcome.  In addition, it is also attractive that SRMs are relatively frequently put on.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
The hardst problem I worked on is <a href="http://rose.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/ProblemSet/description.jsp?id=1170">Old Memories</a>, the problem used for ACM/ICPC Japan domestic contest of this year.</p>
<p>In this problem coding a program that runs in acceptable time at the worst case is very hard.<br />
I thought much but I have not solved it yet!!</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
Well, I have no idea&#8230; But if I could be anything, I would like to be a scientist or something.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
I drink much tea when I cannot find a solution and I get upset.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Lately I solve some problems at <a href="http://rose.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/index.jsp">Online Judge</a> for practice of ACM/ICPC and other contests. This online judge covers many problems that was used for domestic contests, so I solve them intriguingly.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?</strong><br />
I put a red cute stuffed cat on my desk.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
I respect many TopCoder members, but my favorite coders are rng_58, (iwi), wata, LayCurse, yasuh.<br />
I often learn fron their algorithm and solution.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10437190">Design:  caru</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/cimg4801.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1850" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/cimg4801-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><br />
<em>caru&#8217;s home town, Livigno, seen from the top of a mountain.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
Flexibility of working place and schedule.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t think there was a particularly hard project.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
I would be the owner of a web/software company, like TopCoder.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
Almost everything.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing? </strong><br />
Mountain biking, snowboarding, reading, hiking, coding, sky-watching, juggling, singing.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?</strong><br />
No lucky charms.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
argolite, because in my opinion he is the most determined and strong competitor in the Design side of TopCoder software, especially in the long run, like in the current TCO.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=iamtong">Studio: iamtong</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from Studio competitions?</strong><br />
Well, this place makes me become stronger on both design skill and mentality.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
It was the Doja Chat application storyboard design, there were no guidelines or any references.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
A Chef, of course in my own restaurant <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while designing?</strong><br />
Cups of coffee!</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at Studio, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Hanging out at my favorite coffee shop.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when designing?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t have any, but I always avoid 4 &#8211; column layout, never been successful with it, not even get the milestone prizes (I&#8217;ve tried it about 4 times).</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite Studio member or admin and why?</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve got a lot <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />  here are some of them&#8230;.<br />
gh3ablo is a quick and energetic bug racer/ designer, I&#8217;ve always been impressed by oninkxronda&#8217;s designs, idblack also shows a lot of potential, new members such as gando, brandonWind have good attitude, invisiblepilot always provided such detailed/helpful feedback, adroc loves questions &#8211; he always seems nervous when members don&#8217;t ask <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are continuing to write recipes for the Algorithm and Marathon parts of the TopCoder Cookbook. To provide some extra motivation on this project, we are adding short-term rewards.</p>
<p>The first 12 contributors to deliver an approved recipe for one of these chapters, will win a TopCoder t-shirt. The t-shirt will be shipped out as soon as the review board approves the recipe &#8211; no waiting for the book to be published!</p>
<p>Each of the eligible recipes must be done by only one person from start to finish; with optional comments from other members. This means that you have either to finish a recipe you have already submitted in round 1 or 2, or write a recipe nobody has started yet.</p>
<p>We also want to remind you that the top 60 contributors on the Cookbook project receive a free copy of the Cookbook once it is published. So far it is virtually every competitor, so hurry up to grab your freebies!</p>
<p>See the list of recipes available for finishing and writing from scratch <a href="http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&amp;threadID=684003">here</a>.</p>
<p>As usual, all comments and questions can be posted to the forums or directly to TopCoder member Nickolas, here michaylova@gmail.com.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/p1190237.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1767" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/p1190237-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><br />
<em>Anton[SUrSU] </em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
I have fun while solving interesting algorithmic and software design problems. I like analyzing different approaches and techniques, studying new areas in Computer Science. And it’s a great possibility to realize my ambitions in competitions like TopCoder SRM’s.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I’ve been working on increasing my skills in algorithms and data structures for 2 months. TopCoder Algorithm Arena is a great world where I started to live. Besides algorithmic area I was involved in the development of the new platform for the large business intelligence application named CorVu. It was a significant practice for me.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
I`ve already had it <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> . There are so many interesting areas in Computer Science where I would want to be a Professional and share experience with other people, give them my best practices.<br />
Now Google Company is my dream. I`d like to work there.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
I don’t eat while solving problems.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
I like reading adventure stories and programming articles, traveling over the world and spending time with my dear girlfriend Jane.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
Usually I invoke God&#8217;s blessing <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />   Luck, peace and quiet are enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
I am impressed by many TopCoder members. But my favorite players are <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10574855">Petr</a>, <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22221928">UdH-WiNGeR</a>, <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22692969">rng_58</a>, <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22263204">tourist</a>. I like to study their solutions which have a clear algorithm and high programming culture. It’s a good way to improve current skills.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22846687">Design: mekanizumu</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mekanizumu_sichuan.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1768" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mekanizumu_sichuan-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />

I&#8217;d like to do TC as long as it&#8217;s good. I simply want to work at home.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t eat or drink while competing. That&#8217;s bad for the digestion system because the blood is in the brain, not in the stomach.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
I&#8217;d like to play a lot of basketball and ride a BIG motorbike while working on TC for a living.</p>

I don&#8217;t have any lucky charm.</p>

Great earnings, creative and design skills development.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
No specific project. I think it&#8217;s just a time management problem. I&#8217;ve been busy with my work at the same time as a lot of family events and gatherings.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working? </strong><br />
Managing my own business, a resort in my hometown, or a design studio for print, web, photography and advertising in Manila.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while designing?</strong><br />
Potato chips, dried mangoes and a glass of water.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at Studio, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Spending time with my wife and daughter, working for Bleam and Bluewire, doing some freelance work and personal projects.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when designing? For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item? </strong><br />
I don’t have any lucky item&#8230;I think it&#8217;s my daughter, she inspired me most of the time.<br />
I used to work late for studio contests and she always gives her goodnight kiss before she goes to bed and says goodluck daddy. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite Studio member or admin and why?</strong><br />

<p><span id="more-3670"></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22744230">Algorithm:  Dembel</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dsc012111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1713" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dsc012111-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><br />
<em>Harbin&#8217;10, ACM ICPC Finals</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
I just have fun solving problems on competitions.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
For the whole month I&#8217;ve been having fun, having rest and staying away from business.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
I would be writer and create new imaginary worlds.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
Usually I don&#8217;t eat and drink.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Studying, reading, spending time with my friends.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
Most important tradition is to have a shave before important competitions. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
Don&#8217;t think I have one.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=15050434">Development:  FireIce</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/img_0503.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1714" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/img_0503-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
<em>FireIce</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
I can learn some new technology and solidify my current skills.  I think the best way to grasp a new technology is to do it. Also I can earn some cash.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Well, all the projects I worked on last month are not very complicated. I think the biggest problem is to make the submission as perfect as possible with little time as I have a regular job to do.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
I&#8217;d like to setup a company that can be built to last:)</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t eat too much while competing. I usually like eating fruits, like watermelon, sugarcane etc.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Even I don&#8217;t compete at TopCoder, I like to stay at home, watching TV and movies, or go out to play basketball.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t believe any lucky charm. I think when competing, you should do your best to eliminate every possible score-down item for your submission. I think a checklist will help you a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
I like saarixx&#8217;s design.  His designs are very clear and for any raised question, his responses are also very clear. And few designers will raise a Design Change thread to record the change raised in development.<br />
This makes the forum clean. I don&#8217;t have much contact with admin. It was my honor to work with Andy (bchops) as Copliot.  It is a special experience about the Software Development Process of TopCoder.</p>
<p><a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=gh3ablo"><strong>Studio:  gh3ablo</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sandboarding.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1711" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sandboarding-300x264.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="264" /></a><br />
<em>gh3ablo sandboarding in a vast sand dune</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from Studio competitions?</strong><br />
Well, I get to learn new design/code techniques, learn how to correct my mistakes, and get to share what I&#8217;ve learned to others. Also what I really like about this is that when I have nothing and deadline is like 1 hour away, I get some sort of adrenaline rush &#8211; feels good, haha!.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I do consider the Submission Viewer Design contest as the hardest project I had to finish last month. There was a lot going on &#8211; I almost had no sleep because of this, but it was worth it! It was not perfect though &#8217;cause it had a couple of things that needed fixin&#8217;, so on we went with the final fixes. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
One of my dreams is to become an CG animator in Disney/Pixar. It&#8217;s unlikely, but it&#8217;s free to dream.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while designing?</strong><br />
Potato chips, usually cheese flavored and a good cup of local brewed coffee.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at Studio, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
There are two things I like to do; a) Play video games, b) Chill on a beach. But sometimes B is not very accessible so, uhmmm&#8230; yep, probably playing video games. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when designing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
I often have my music with me as I work on stuff, mostly some popunk and (power) metal. Probably not a lucky charm, but it gets me in the mood.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite Studio member or admin and why?</strong><br />
I have some &#8211; adroc, silvasurfas, mcards13, iamtong; I like how they run contests/bugs and how they communicate with/help members.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today the TopCoder community surpassed one quarter of a million registered members around the world and we want to take this opportunity to say a big ‘thank you’ to each and every one of you who have contributed and helped us reach this significant milestone. This is truly a shared success – congratulations to us all!</p>
<p>So we have a question: What does the number 250,000 mean to you? Sure, we all know that we could fill the Indianapolis Speedway with that number of people, and it’s the approximate number of distinct words in the English language &#8211; but what other fun numerical trivia comes to mind when you think of the number 250,000?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the Coders and Designers of the Month!  We caught up with a few of them so be sure to check out their <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/news/2010/05/12/meet-the-april-coders-and-designers-of-the-month">interviews</a>.<br />
<span id="more-1607"></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22683547">Algorithm:  stjepan</a><br />
</strong><br />
<div id="attachment_1608" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/stjepan.jpg"><img src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/stjepan-300x186.jpg" alt="stjepan&#039;s small hometown in winter (Prelog)" width="300" height="186" class="size-medium wp-image-1608" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">stjepan's small hometown in winter (Prelog)</p></div><br />
<strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
Fun, adrenaline, practice, meeting people.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
For a very long time I was struggling with yellow color while I felt I could reach red. Performing poorly with almost no rating increase was very frustrating. Slow submissions and bugs kept me from going up, until I decided to solve some SRMs in practice rooms. I&#8217;ve managed to instantly overcome these problems and a nice rating boost appeared on my graph.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
Probably as a coder. I&#8217;m most excited about locations I&#8217;ve never been to.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
Usually a fruit, cookies or chocolate. Cappuccino is a must before night SRMs.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Hanging out with friends, playing football or basketball, studying. And coding, of course. Especially now as I&#8217;m very ambitious about the upcoming IOI in Canada.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
There is a pair of marbles on my desk.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
No favorites! <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
rng_58. I have learnt a lot from his solutions. I also find his problem sets very nice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=21932422"><strong>Design:  saarixx</strong></a><br />
<div id="attachment_1611" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/saarixx.jpg"><img src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/saarixx-300x225.jpg" alt="saarixx snorkeling in Egypt" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-1611" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">saarixx snorkeling in Egypt</p></div><br />
<strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions? </strong><br />
Most of the time the design competitions are a full time job for me, thus of course I am mostly interested in high prizes.</p>
<p>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?<br />
All design competitions in April (in which I&#8217;ve competed) were quite simple. The most difficult part for me was to design 3 Education components during the 4 days.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
I&#8217;d like to try a racing driver career. I am a fan of Formula 1 auto racing, but have never tried to drive myself in real life &#8211; just in computer simulators.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
When designing the components I prefer to separate eating and competing.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
After sitting the whole workweek in front of the monitors I try to recreate actively on weekend. Currently I prefer playing table/court tennis and badminton.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
My favorite PM is WishingBone. He always provides a great support in his competitions. Thanks, Jiazhi <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22718436&amp;tab=dev"><strong>Development:  7realm</strong></a><br />
<div id="attachment_1622" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 298px"><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/7realm.jpg"><img src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/7realm.jpg" alt="Mountains in Crimea (Ukraine) where 7realm likes to spend time climbing the rocks" width="288" height="216" class="size-medium wp-image-1622" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mountains in Crimea (Ukraine) where 7realm likes to spend time climbing the rocks</p></div><br />
<strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions? </strong><br />
An opportunity to do something as good as possible.</p>
<p>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?<br />
All competition of last month were relatively simple. The only problem was to follow component forums because of the large number of competitors.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
It will be something related to mountains:)</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
I like to drink green tea.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Nothing like this, I rely only on my mind.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
As a developer I like to implement design works of saarixx because he provide good and clean design and forum support.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=donot6">Studio:  donot6</a><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from Studio competitions?</strong><br />
Beside the prizes, there are opportunities to work on various kind of projects.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
$1000 TC Direct &#8211; Contest Type Icon!!!</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
Farmer <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  I&#8217;ll be working in my country, Thailand.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while designing?</strong><br />
Iced Coffee.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at Studio, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Working on client projects, Photo shooting.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when designing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t have one, Still looking for it <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite Studio member or admin and why?</strong><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the Coders and Designers of the Month!  We caught up with a few of them so be sure to check out their <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/news/2010/04/12/meet-the-march-coders-and-designers-of-the-month">interviews</a>.<br />
<span id="more-3616"></span><br />
<strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=287614">Design:  argolite</a><br />
</strong><br />
<strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s my full-time job, so it have to be the compensation.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I think that the most challenging projects are the ones looking into some new technology or new versions of existing technology. Recently we had an interesting architecture that worked with HTML 5. It was good to work on something new, but coupled with the fact that I have not worked on JavaScript in much detail in a while, made this the most challenging competition.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
probably switch to something like creative writing. I have done a bit of that a while back and really enjoyed it. The nice thing about work like that is that it can be done anywhere, sort of like my current job.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
With the amount of sitting involved in this work, I try to eat healthy as much as possible, but if it gets very intense, it usually means a lot of Pepsi and ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Trying to catch up on sleep and fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
No lucky charms. I have learned that the best thing I can do to help in my competitions is get adequate sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
No favorites! <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
There are a lot of PMs I enjoy working with, as they are good with their specs and responses.</p>

<em>Zhongshan.  The scene of the city.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions? </strong><br />
friends, technique, and prizes</p>
<p>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?<br />
Ilium series. It uses the thing I never touch.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
A traveler around the world.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
yoghurt</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
sleep, watching movies, and traveling</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
No lucky charm.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
Dave (mess). Seems he has left. Because he was the admin who sent the Spring Festive blessing. The feeling is good. And I love his face. Cute. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<strong>What is the major return you get from Studio competitions?</strong><br />
I just love the competition spirit in Studio and enjoy competing with other Studio members. The competition prizes are great and help me earn while working from home.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
eAHR Wireframes- part 1 was a little hard. It was a bit difficult to understand the requirements.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
I will be a writer and travel around the world.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while designing?</strong><br />
Coffee,  most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at Studio, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Playing with or taking care of my 1.5 year old daughter.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when designing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
Nothing like that. But I always use IE browser to view the competition results.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite Studio member or admin and why?</strong><br />
I have not had much contact with the admins. I do have a lot of respect for my fellow studio competitors selvia_ettine, oton, systic  and others and it is great competing with them. Even though I don’t know any of them personally, I feel they are my friends.</p>

In terms of your contests, unless otherwise specified they will be included in the online qualifying rounds for the TCO.  That means competitors have an additional incentive.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Race Specifics<br />
</strong><br />
When you are creating new Bug Races be sure to set the TCO Points field on them like you did last year.  If you don&#8217;t want it to be part of the TCO round for whatever reason, you have the option to set it to zero.</p>
<p>Since it is a required field, as you resolve existing Bug Races it will force you to set an amount.  Set it to zero IF your Bug Race was posted prior to 9am EST today (March 29).</p>
<p>You have 3 point levels you can set &#8211; 10,20 or 30.  Use your best judgment to determine the right setting that each Bug Race warrants.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TopCoder Marathon Match 58, IsolatedPrimes, has now begun. You have until April 7, 2010 at 13:00 UTC -4 to finalize your submission.</p>
<p>Prime numbers are an integral part of many problems; perhaps most notably they appear heavily in encryption algorithms.  An isolated prime number is one that does not have very many other prime numbers nearby.  In this problem, you have to try to answer questions like:<br />
What is the smallest prime number x such that there are no other prime numbers in [x-10,x+10]?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22263204">tourist</a> needed just 44 minutes in order to solve all 3 problems in the Championship Round of 2010 TopCoder High School Tournament. He had to resubmit 1000-pointer, but even this did not prevent him from winning the tournament.</p>
<p><span id="more-1520"></span>He was the first to submit in the match with impressive 247.80 points (2 minutes 43 seconds) on the 250-pointer, this ended up being the fastest correct solution on the Easy problem overall. However, the other competitors were close. During the first 5 minutes of the match there were 7 submissions on this problem, during the first 10 minutes there were 32.</p>
<p>tourist was also the first to submit the 600-pointer, it happened in the beginning of 24th minute for 444.61 points. It seemed like tourist would consolidate his lead, but other competitors were even faster. In the end of 24th minute exod40 submitted the 600-pointer for 465.72 points and took the first position leaving tourist behind. Three more submissions on 600-pointer followed on 25th minute and by its end tourist was only on 4th position.</p>
<p>Most important events in the match happend around 40th minute. On 39:36 neal_wu, who skipped the 600-pointer and went directly for 1000-pointer, submitted it for 591.09 and claimed the top spot. On 40:25 meret, who used the same strategy as neal_wu, submitted the 1000-pointer for 564.35 thus taking the second position. However, what was really surprising is the blazingly fast submission on 1000-pointer by tourist, 883.71 (!!!) points, he showed that it would be very hard to beat him in this match. It seemed that the first place would clearly go to him.</p>
<p>However, it was not so easy. On 44:05, tourist resubmitted the 1000-pointer, his new score was 720.82, but it still was much more than his nearest rival (neal_wu) had. But on 53:37, neal_wu submitted 600-pointer for very high 526.71 points (it ended up being the fastest correct solution on this problem). As a result, neal_wu appeared to be just 62 points behind tourist, so 2 successfull challenges would put him on top of standings.</p>
<p>Coding proceeded and more submissions on all problems came. By the end of coding phase, there were 83 submissions on 250, 48 submissions on 600 and<br />
9 submissions on 1000. The top-5 looked as follows: tourist (1413.23), neal_wu (1361.0), ikicic (1332.05), exod40 (1299.14), lyrically (1185.09).</p>
<p>Challenge phase was not very eventful, but some important permutations happened within the top part of the table. ikicic&#8217;s 1000-pointer has been challenged, so exod40 moved to the third place. Additionally, exod40 gained one successfull challenge, so his score became 1349.14. At the same time neal_wu, who really needed challenged to overcome tourist, started with two unsuccessfull challenges and that lowered his score to 1311.0.</p>
<p>Therefore, exod40 moved to the second place and neal_wu became third instead of beating tourist. Of course, neal_wu didn&#8217;t want to agree with such result, so he tried to go for more challenges. But it was just not his day, the challenge on 09:56 was also unsuccessfull. On 14:28 he tried to challenged his rival exod40, but again unsuccessfully. He got his successfull challenge on 14:53, but it was not enough even to reclaim the second place.</p>
<p>Systests broke a lot of submissions on 250 and 600 pointers, but left the top competitors untouched.</p>
<p>tourist became TCHS10 Champion with a score of 1413,23. The second place goes to exod40 (1349,14), neal_wu is third (1311,0).

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the February Coders and Designers of the Month!  We are happy to hear from all of them this month.<br />
<span id="more-3598"></span><br />
<strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22678332&amp;tab=alg">Algorithm:  awakia</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/izakaya1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1477" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/izakaya1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
<em>Here is awakia at a Japanese-style pub &#8220;Izakaya&#8221;. There he can enjoy many kinds of foods and drinks. He is on the left with lab members.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
TopCoder brings me exciting times! Algorithm competitions are like a refreshment of daily life. Discussions on the Twitter after the competition also make me fan.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Job Hunting!<br />
Due to Lehman Shock, it&#8217;s tough time&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
I would want to program a human, though I don&#8217;t know I can do that. If there were any projects like that, I would join the project.</p>
<p>I have no preference about place, so anywhere is acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
I eat nothing, but I often eat instant noodles after the competition.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Sleeping, playing badminton, talking with friends, writing report, or coding anyway.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t have any lucky charm&#8230; But, as you may know, a piece of paper helps me a lot while competing.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22692969">rng_58</a></p>
<p>He is high school coder, but his codes are like mathematical equations. I often read his code to study. Additionally, he sometimes sets SRM problems and they are all interesting. So I respect him.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22652765&amp;tab=des">Design:  moonli</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
I learn a lot from TopCoder competitions, including algorithm and software skills and how to cooperate with others.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I think it&#8217;s &#8220;Interactive DDL Wrapper&#8221;, which is in a large scope, and I didn&#8217;t have enough time to work on it, it made me nervous at that time.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
Mostly a software engineer, in some place in my country.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
Tea made with fresh tea leaves and gum, which make me relax.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Gaming, mountain climbing, or cooking.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
Honestly speaking, I don&#8217;t have a lucky charm, I just don&#8217;t believe in something like that.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
Haha, Jessie D’Amato Ford! Always good news comes in her email.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22698133&amp;tab=dev">Development:  Lunarmony</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/14092009180.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1478" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/14092009180.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a><br />
<em>Beautiful sunset near lunarmony&#8217;s home.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
Practice opportunities and earnings.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
There were no particularly hard projects. Fixing bugs in assembly competitions can get annoying, though.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
Any career that allows me to maximize my potential.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t think it is good to eat while working in front of a computer.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Well&#8230; virtually everything&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t believe in such things.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
ACRush.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=oninkxronda">Studio:  oninkxronda</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/oninkxronda.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1479" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/oninkxronda.png" alt="" width="203" height="300" /></a><br />
<em>Here is oninkxronda on a family trip to Hong Kong last year.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from Studio competitions?</strong><br />
Aside from great additional earnings, I enhance my design skills and speed.</p>
<p>I’m having fun competing.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
It’s not really the hardest project, I think it’s more a situation…I was working on a t-shirt design last month with my daughter in the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working? </strong><br />
Well, I’d love to travel, taking photos around the world. All expenses paid.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while designing?</strong><br />
Jack&#8217;nJill Pretzel chocolate sticks and a glass of water.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at Studio, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
I’m working at Offshoring Inc. Monday to Friday, 7am to 4pm.</p>
<p>During weekend I play PS3 with my wife, having fun with my 2 year old daughter, teaching her how to read, write, draw, color, solve a puzzle and sometimes teaching her how to hold a computer mouse. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when designing? For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item? </strong><br />
I don&#8217;t really have any specific lucky charm or food item. I always have my energy drink that keeps me awake during late night deadlines.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite Studio member or admin and why?</strong><br />
I already met Jess and Jessie in Vegas, they&#8217;re nice and approachable. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are now releasing new site wireframes so members registered on our contests can begin to see what it is our TopCoder designers have been striving towards.</p>
<p>For the last couple of months we’ve been running contests to design a new e-commerce web site built upon Microsoft Commerce Server’s Sharepoint Commerce Services. While a large application, it has been broken down into more than 20 small components, and those components use standard Microsoft .NET technologies like .NET 3.5 and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hhy9ewf1.aspx">ASP.NET Web Parts</a>.</p>
<p>Get involved and join us as we build this new, public facing, world-class web site! There’s never been a better time to bring your talent to our team of over 200 TopCoder members who have already participated.</p>
<p>For more information including dedicated project forums, VM information, and downloads, visit the <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wiki/display/~axiom/ECommerce+Sites">E-Commerce Sites Project Hub</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TopCoder just launched the TopCoder Computational Thinking Idea Contest and we&#8217;re counting on you for BIG ideas!</p>
<p>We are interested in creating one or more new types of competitions that would appeal  to grade school level kids (~ ages 12 through 18) who may not yet have discovered an aptitude or appreciation for mathematics or computer programming.</p>
<p>Back in December, we asked for some ideas along the same lines in <a href="http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&amp;threadID=659292">this forum thread</a> and got some good ideas.</p>
<p>We decided to run an idea generation contest for some more great stuff and will be giving away up to five prizes of $300 each for the idea submissions that we believe are good enough for us to actually follow through and build out.</p>
<p>Please read the full contest details <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProjectDetail&amp;pj=30009729">here</a> for all the important information.</p>

I don&#8217;t know if the hardest, but the one that I dedicated most time lately would be training on an ACM ICPC team (Ni JiRaFa from Universidad Nacional de La Plata) for the World Finals that will be held this week on Harbin, China.</p>
<p>We did a mini Training Camp back at my apartment in Buenos Aires. We spent a week doing contest rehearsals every day and discussing problems.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve got an ever increasing interest for an academic career. Probably, getting a PhD and doing Scientific Research on Algorithms would be a good plan for me. Where? If I had to choose I&#8217;d like to live and work in Europe for some time.</p>
<p>Google sounds as an interesting option as well.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
I usually don&#8217;t eat anything while competing. I sometimes drink mate, a typical infusion very popular in Argentina.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t know, I could be doing many different things. I like to play football and basketball. Meeting with friends, going to the park. I started to swim last year. Sometimes I&#8217;ve got to study (I&#8217;m finishing a Computer Science degree). I really enjoy watching movies, I&#8217;m quite a cinephile. And, from time to time, I just like to do nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t have any item that I consider a source of luck. Some time ago, I used to get ready for the contest with a little anticipation, test that everything was working fine, set a quiet environment, listen to some music, and relax. But lately, I just grab the laptop and compete when I feel like doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
I must say is Petr. I always saw him as a model to follow. His codes are really clear, and he solves almost any problem.</p>
<p>When I started to compete at Topcoder, he was performing incredibly well, he took Ranking #1 from Tomek&#8217;s long streak, and won Google Code Jam. I guess he became my favourite from that time, when I was just starting with this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22498968">Design:  flying2hk</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/pingyao.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1418" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/pingyao.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p><em>Pingyao, China &#8211; a very old town dating back to 827 B.C, inscripted by UNESCO as a World Heritage.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from TopCoder competitions?</strong><br />
Flexible working schedule and great earnings.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
The first several XOWL components really took me a while to understand the overall architecture and how they fit together.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
Well, doing what J. K. Rowling has been doing I guess.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while competing?</strong><br />
Potato crisps + cold water.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at TopCoder, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Mostly reading, or, sleeping <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when competing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
Potato crisps, again <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite TopCoder member or admin and why?</strong><br />
WishingBone &#8211; an idol in the Chinese TopCoder circle.</p>
<p><a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=selvia_ettine">Studio:  selvia_ettine</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/meright-my-sister.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1419" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/meright-my-sister.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="292" /></a></p>
<p><em>selvia_ettine (on right) with her sister.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the major return you get from Studio competitions?</strong><br />
The prizes are great! But more than that is the experience of collaborating with people from all around the world on a project and make everything possible.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Probably the Jachin Project Resource Tracker Dashboard Wireframe. Making the wireframe to be dynamic sized was complicated, but it was a new and good experience for me.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have any career in the world, what would you be doing and where would you be working?</strong><br />
I would be an astronaut working in the International Space Station.</p>
<p><strong>What can we find you eating and/or drinking while designing?</strong><br />
Tea, tea, and more tea&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not competing at Studio, what can we find you doing?</strong><br />
Playing my Nintendo DS.</p>
<p><strong>What is your lucky charm when designing?  For example, special shirt, stuffed animal, or food item?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t really have any lucky charm. I do have a habit of biting my nails when working though <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite Studio member or admin and why?</strong><br />
I like all admins and members. Everyone is very helpful.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Just want to give you a quick update on a couple things that were added to Cockpit tonight. </p>
<p>1 .  Any contest that is in a &#8220;failed&#8221; state (i.e.  cancelled &#8211; blah, blah) will have a &#8220;Repost&#8221; option in the dropdown next to the contest.  It&#8217;ll prompt you when you select it to confirm that you want to repost and tells you no additional fee is applied  (the contest fee will be zero) .  It copies the original contest with a start date of today + 48 hours.  The contest will be in &#8220;draft&#8221; status.   At that point you can treat it just like you would a new contest.<br />
     ** This does not include Studio contests.  Studio reposts should still be treated as new contests.</p>
<p>2 .  You can create new versions of components in basically the same way you do the repost.  Any component design or dev contest that is complete will have the options in the dropdown to create a new version of the design and/or dev.  It will  create a copy of the original contest and leaves the new contest in &#8220;draft&#8221; status.  At that point you can treat it just like you would a new contest.  </p>
<p>3.  If you run into any issues please let us know.  So that we can handle issues with some sort of order, please email them to internal-support@topcoder.com.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re moving the rest of the software contest types over to the new spec review process as of now.  This includes everything except for studio contests.  Please discontinue using the TCSSPEC Jira project for spec reviews after your current reviews are complete.  Studio reviews will remain as-is for now.</p>
<p>The process described below is still the same (it&#8217;s the same process you&#8217;ve been using for UI Prototypes and RIA Builds).  Here is a full guide you can use for your reference as well as for your clients:  http://www.topcoder.com/wiki/display/docs/Specification+Review+Guide</p>
<p>Spec Reviews will launch automatically when you activate your contests.  They will not be created for component dev contests that are tied to a design.  You will see the spec review show up as a project in OR that is linked to the contest.  Members will see an opportunity on the existing Review Opportunities pages.  </p>
<p>If you have a reason to not do a spec review or you need a non-standard spec review payment (currently set at $50), please let me know in advance of activating the contest and also let me know why so we can understand how to account for it in the process.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the Coders and Designers of the Month!  Check out some <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/news/2010/01/12/meet-the-december-coders-and-designers-of-the-month">interviews</a> and be sure to congratulate them!</p>
<p><span id="more-1376"></span><br />
<strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22680734&amp;tab=alg">Algorithm:  abhilashr</a></strong><br />
<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dsc01995.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1377" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dsc01995.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
I really enjoy the contest format in TopCoder SRMs. There is an emphasis on speed and accuracy, besides problem solving, which makes competing all the more exciting. The short contest durations make it easy to drop in for a contest even on the busiest of days.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Well, no problem I attempted last month measures up to the amount of effort I had to put into some front end work on a website. Javascript, I can deal with, but CSS is man&#8217;s gravest mistake <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif' alt=':-|' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
Not that I&#8217;ve won so many to talk about, but a clear mind and an empty head certainly seems to do the trick for me <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  At least in algorithm competitions, I&#8217;ve found that nothing helps more than clarity of thought during the contest.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
Not all ideas and gestures can be deep and profound. At times you just say no to creativity and type out your name in lower case with no spaces or periods like a mad man. That&#8217;s my handle <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
Having known myself for most of my life, I don&#8217;t find anything surprising about me anymore! But I&#8217;m sure people who&#8217;ve known me just for the past few years would be quite thrilled to know I used to do my fair share of mountain biking back when I was a kid. Boy, those were the days! <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=21932422&amp;tab=des"><strong>Design:  saarixx</strong></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?&lt;a href="><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1380" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/com-2009-12-saarixx2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></strong><br />
<em>One of resorts in the center of saarixx&#8217;s city &#8211; Dnipropetrovsk</em></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
When I compete in design competitions full time, I like that my earnings are proportional to the spent time and effort. And I know that I will get a reward for each hour additionally spent on work.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
The hardest component designed by me and finished in December was TROL Order Locator. The requirements were quite difficult to understand. I and reviewer understood them differently, thus we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time on clarifications.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
IMHO, the main factor is time spent on exploring solutions provided by winners of previous competitions. This is applicable to most types of competitions: Marathon, Algorithm, Design, Conceptualization, Architecture, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
My initials are SAA. I added RIX to them just to make it sound cool and funny, with no exact meaning. Then I googled for SAARIX and found that it&#8217;s not unique in the world wide web. To make it unique I added an additional &#8220;X&#8221; to the end. Thus my handle is SAARIXX, and if you find some web page with word &#8220;SAARIXX&#8221; on it &#8211; be sure it&#8217;s about me <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=abedavera">Studio:  abedavera</a></strong><br />

<p><em>abedavera and his girlfriend Vera</em></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part about Studio?</strong><br />
Open the &#8220;Congratulations&#8221; thread and see my name as a winner <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project you worked on last month?</strong><br />
The hardest project was Generic Corporate Website Contest, 9 pages with full of tables, text, lists, icons, buttons, tabs, also the logo. But that was a great contest before new year 2010 for me!</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at Studio?</strong><br />
Just make it simple and clean, and create something different sometimes! -&gt;tips to get the milestone prize <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
abedavera means abe (my middle name, albertho) and vera (my lovely girlfriend).</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
Fulltimer at Studio Topcoder. Is that surprising??? lol</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you have experience with Perl?  What about other programming languages?  If so, we need your help!  We are urgently looking for a Perl reviewer for the following project.</p>
<p>The PERL WebComposer Search and Replace Script is a command based component that will be used to mass modify XML, XSL, and HTML files to search for a specific string sequence and replace it with another string sequence. The script should be able to search for fixed strings that may have some dynamic parts indicated by wildcard characters such as &#8216;*&#8217; or &#8216;?&#8217;. The script will be run from the command line and will be chained with other scripts to perform its work.</p>
<p>Review compensation is $300 and $250.</p>
<p>Here are the contest <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProjectDetail&amp;pj=30008558">details</a> and also <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ReviewProjectDetail&amp;pj=30008558&amp;pt=1">here</a>.</p>
<p>We are always looking for new reviewers so if you&#8217;re down with Perl, Python or any other programming language new at TopCoder, check out the ongoing review and competition opportunities <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/news/allactivecontests/">here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10597114">Psyho</a>, the winner of the NVIDIA CUDA Superhero Challenge 2!<br />
<span id="more-1358"></span><br />
<strong><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.topcoder.com/i/m/Psyho_big.jpg" alt="" width="126" height="140" />Can you describe the problem and the ensuing thought process that became your successful solution?</strong><br />
The problem we had to solve was a variation of a classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">TSP</a>. The main difference was that the cities (in the problem statement planes play the role of cities) didn&#8217;t have a fixed position, but instead each day they were placed on a different random point completely independent of previous positions. And on each day we had to visit exactly one city and we could travel an infinite distance.</p>
<p>That change made it very hard to improve your solution in small steps, since if you changed the order of even only 2 visits, you get 2 compelely different positions and probably at least 1 of them is so far that it makes that change worthless and automatically discarded.</p>
<p>My solution used a simulated annealing optimization technique to gradually improve my solution. And in each step I tried to change the order of several visits in a greedy-like manner. You can read more about the solutions in the <a href="http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&amp;threadID=657848">“Post your approach” thread</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Was there a &#8216;steep learning curve&#8217; or did you find it easy to adapt to the requirements for this CUDA-specific competition?</strong><br />
Surprisingly, it turned out that CUDA is much easier to learn that I would have ever suspected. I guess I would need around 5 to 10 minutes to explain CUDA&#8217;s basics to any decent C++ developer with multi-threading experience. However, while it&#8217;s easy to write anything that works, it takes quite a lot of time to optimize it. In principle, writing for CUDA is very similar to standard multi-threaded programming, but the huge number of concurrent threads, and concepts like shared memory and blocks, create a few subtle changes.</p>
<p><strong>Did you access the CUDA webinars provided by NVIDIA?</strong><br />
Yes &#8211; I&#8217;ve seen first three slides from <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpu_computing_online.html">here</a>. They provide a great start, since after reading them I was pretty much ready for developing with CUDA. I haven&#8217;t watched the videos as from my perspective reading is a few times faster than listening. I have also quickly skimmed through official documentation but I haven&#8217;t really found anything useful besides the execution speed of operations.</p>
<p>There was one thing that was really missing from those slides. There should be a paragraph with common mistakes from developers. I wasted a lot of precious time on debugging, because I wasn&#8217;t following such basic guidelines like checking CUDA errors. It seems that few years of competing in algorithmic competitions completely spoiled me and now it&#8217;s natural for me, that I believe if something doesn&#8217;t work, I can find the mistake just by looking at my code.</p>
<p><strong>What did you think of the testing environment &#8211; thoughts on the hardware?</strong><br />
I can&#8217;t really say much about the hardware. It was my first experience with computing power of GPUs in general. It definitely has a lot of potential, and it&#8217;s probably the future of computing in terms of power/cost. But currently it&#8217;s hard to draw the line between CPU vs GPU, because it depends entirely on the solved problem and optimizations used (like using SSE for CPU).</p>
<p><strong>Where are you in your academic career these days? What are you studying and what are your future plans?</strong><br />
Oh, the fun part of the interview <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  As I stated somewhere in the forum, right now I&#8217;m trying to finish my master&#8217;s thesis (something about poker AI). To be honest, I should have finished my studies about<br />
2 years ago, but I never really cared about that. I was thinking a bit about going for a PhD, but since I&#8217;m so lazy, and I don&#8217;t have a &#8220;scientific mind&#8221; I decided it&#8217;s not for me. But on the other hand I don&#8217;t enjoy programming except for problem solving, so probably you won&#8217;t see me in any company &#8211; unless I could get a job with a decent salary where I could work remotely on interesting (and not tedious) problems. And not more than 2-3 hours a day (of course with full flexibility). If someone has such an offer for me then feel free to drop me an email <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Do you have any new hobbies or interests when you&#8217;re not studying or competing in TopCoder?</strong><br />
Currently, except for my thesis, I&#8217;m in the middle of doing nothing <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  I still participate in a wide variety of logic puzzles competitions, which I can recommend to anyone who likes doing SRMs from time to time. They also have their annual onsite competitions &#8211; much like TCO, but unfortunately not in Vegas <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  From my perspective they&#8217;re much more mentally demanding than algorithmic competitions, but on flip side they test a much narrower set of skills. I&#8217;d say that the fact I was able to get to the &#8220;target&#8221; ranking in algorithms is almost solely because of those puzzle competitions. A few web pages I can recommend &#8211; <a href="http://oapc.wpc2009.org/">OAPC site</a> which had several competitions of great quality, USA official <a href="http://wpc.puzzles.com/">WPF site</a> &#8211; with qualification tests for USA team, <a href="http://www.nikoli.com/en/">nikoli site</a> &#8211; daily puzzles with ability to see how other people are solving, <a href="http://puzzlepicnic.com/">puzzlepicnic</a> &#8211; AFAIK the work of fellow TopCoder members <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  And hopefully I will be launching a similar site to nikoli somewhere in the next year, but that&#8217;s a distant future <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to our November Coders and Designers of the month.  They put on an excellent performance in November and are very deserving of this honor.</p>
<p><span id="more-1340"></span><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10348862"><strong>Design:  Lu</strong>ca</a></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
The Design and Architecture competitions are my favorite. Also, the possibility to have a flexible schedule is a great thing.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the TopCoder site is this <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=dev&amp;d2=umltool&amp;d3=credits&amp;node=des_uml_tool">one</a>. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
The &#8220;Presentation Engine Transport Module Architecture&#8221; was a really interesting project. We were required to create a framework and a model for a client-server Presentation standard, which had a professionally written specification.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
These days, it is more important to create complete deliverables, that include all the small details.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
My name is Lucian, but it is hard for non Romanians to pronounce it correctly. So I simplified it: Luca.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
It&#8217;s not really a &#8220;surprising thing&#8221;, but I can&#8217;t think of something else: I just got the driving license for motorcycles.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22767514&amp;tab=dev"><strong>Development:  azukun</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
When I signed up to the TC a year ago to participate in algorithm contests, SRMs momentarily became my favorite contest format with great possibilities to learn from other members. Six months later I tried development contests and now I&#8217;m proud to be a full-time developer for TopCoder with many advantages associated with this and my favorite part of the TC is a possibility to be one.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
This is Aphaea AutoAudit .net Audit Report Services without any doubts.<br />
It is a rather complex component with many classes, dependencies, and a necessity to implement CRUD operations for small, but tricky DB schema aside from report processing.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
Hard work and ability to learn quickly.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
This is a sad story <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Originally I&#8217;ve used &#8216;Az&#8217; as my handle everywhere, but when I was signing up for gmail, such address was already busy, off course. Since I was a fan of anime in those times I&#8217;ve used such japanized version and when I signed up to the TC, I couldn&#8217;t find anything better than to reuse same handle. Now I&#8217;m not so happy with my choice then, that&#8217;s why it is sad <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
You can see one surprising thing by looking on my profile, i.e. while Russia is a leading country in the algorithm contests for now, I&#8217;m the only .NET developer from my country and there is one more Java developer, that&#8217;s all! At least, it was sad and surprising for me.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=oton">Studio:  oton</a></strong><br />
<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/img_2258.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1341" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/img_2258.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><em>This is my desk while I worked on the last wireframe project in Studio.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Setup: iMac 20&#8243; circa 2007, 2.4Ghz with 4GB DDR2 memory, HDD 320GB with 2TB Western Digital external drive and 1 TB Time Capsule for remote backup, Belkin USB hub, HP Deskjet 3920 printer, some design and development books (my favorite for IA projects are Jenifer Tidwell&#8217;s Designing Interfaces), DreamWeaver as main XHTML/CSS editor with their unbeatable sites caching features (sure I like other editor like Coda, but for this main reason I pick DW), Photoshop, Illustrator, Fireworks, one office chair with the left arm rest already broken, an iPod Touch 32GB (a gift from AOL contest) for some errands activities (game!) and musics, and a cup of tea or coffee (sometime) brought by my wife.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part about Studio?</strong><br />
Winning a contest with over 5 or more submitters. But I&#8217;d love it much more if the submitters were only me or the other submitter <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Gea Community Maps wireframe (Phase 1). I didn&#8217;t participate in Phase 2 and Phase 3 for this very reason <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at Studio?</strong><br />
Hard work and consistency.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s my nickname. No story. Period. With smile <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
My daughter (3.5yrs) is always sneaking into my room, and asked me my opinion of her new creations or toys. I usually end up talking with her, or playing with her, and sometime postponed to work later.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we announced that TopCoder(R) is increasing the Digital Run Rewards for every software and Studio contest going forward by 25%. This means there are more DR points available for every contest and more money going into the guaranteed monthly DR prize pools, which means larger Digital Run payouts and more reason than ever to compete. This is just one step in our ongoing effort to reward your participation in TopCoder competitions beyond the prize money won in any particular contest.</p>
<p>Part of this effort too is gaining more understanding of what drives you to compete. While participation in TopCoder contests remains strong, with the addition of new contest tracks and the anticipation of much higher volume, we want to stay ahead of the curve to make sure competing at TopCoder is as enticing and rewarding as it can possibly be.</p>
<p>We have attached a short survey which we would appreciate if you took the time to complete, and we invite you to provide us with any additional information or feedback in the space provided.</p>
<p>As an added incentive, we will be choosing twenty respondents at random and awarding a TopCoder t-shirt to each, just for completing the survey! You must complete the survey by Wednesday, December 16, 2009 to be eligible to win a t-shirt.</p>
<p>View the survey <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ViewSurvey&amp;sid=30510">here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s more reason than ever to compete at TopCoder!</p>
<p>Effective immediately we are <a href="http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&amp;threadID=657856&amp;start=0&amp;mc=1#1173114">increasing the Digital Run points</a> in every competition track &#8211; including <a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/forums?module=Thread&amp;threadID=6508">Studio</a> &#8211; by 25%.</p>
<p>This means more points are awarded per contest, and more money is available in the guaranteed monthly <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/dr">Digital Run Prize Pools</a>.</p>
<p>The increases take effect with any new contest entered into the pipeline &#8211; contests that are already scheduled will go forward with their existing assigned DR points.</p>
<p>At TopCoder we always strive to reward quality participation beyond the prize money given to the winners of any particular contest. This increase is just one part of that ongoing effort.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/dr">learn more about the Digital Run here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <em>You will note that the pool for Design - which includes Conceptualization, Specification, Architecture and Component Design contests -  is already up to $6,500, just 10 days into the month and even before these DR increases take effect. Now is the time to compete in these contests and win your piece of the December DR Pool!</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the October designers and coders of the month.  We hope you enjoy their <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/news/2009/11/20/meet-the-october-coders-and-designers-of-the-month">interviews</a>!</p>
<p><span id="more-1303"></span><br />
<strong>Algorithm: <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22777893">pieguy</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
The algorithm competitions, of course.  I wish there were more.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m currently designing a tile-based game (for fun).  The hardest part is keeping the rules of the game as simple as possible without limiting the potential variety.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
I&#8217;d say solution testing.  I&#8217;ve learned to test my solutions even after I submit.  Several times I&#8217;ve discovered a bug after I submitted and had to resubmit, but 10% resubmit penalty beats the 100% incorrectness penalty.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
Love to bake it, love to eat it.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I memorized 400 digits of pi.</p>
<p><strong>Design:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=14820574">zsudraco</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
I like these:<br />
(a) Freedom to choose interesting tasks to work on.<br />
(b) Freedom to arrange my working time.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
All the projects I worked on last month were simple.  A relatively hard one may be the Mapping File and String Truncation API component; I needed to make an efficient binary search algorithm to loacate entries in a file.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
I just won several simple designs last month.  And for simple components, skills may not be very important, just be diligent and work hard on every aspects as detailed as possible.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
I played ACM algorithm contests in college.  There are several teams, the team names are &#8220;zsu&#8221; + a constellation name, &#8220;zsu&#8221; is the college name.  And my team name is just zsudraco, I simply used that name as my handle.  It is not quite meaningful.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I have a surprising accident several months ago, but it is not about TopCoder or information technology.</p>
<p>One night, I parked my car in a dark corner.  When I was going to drive it back home, I just started the engine, and two guys came inside my car, &#8230; they robbed of my car.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I just had a light injury.  More fortunately, several days later they had a car accident and left the car in road, and policemen called me to get back my car.</p>
<p>This accident gave me a big lesson that I want to share:<br />
Do not park your car in dark corner; after getting into car, lock the doors ASAP.</p>
<p><strong>Development:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=15076432">yext</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
Members can get involved in almost all stages of a project. I learned quite a lot when acting as developer, designer, architect, and co-pilot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a student but I can gain lots of experience before leaving school, this is great. Thank you TopCoder.</p>

It is &#8220;PPM Proctor Pages 1&#8243;. I had no experience on JavaScript or jQuery before this competition, and I spent much time learning them.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
As a competitor on assembly competitions, I think the most important factor to win is to get familiar with the system early. For example, most competitions I won on October are from the PPM series. Before those contests, I reviewed all PPM prototype conversion contests, and participated many Bug Races on PPM component deployment. Those helped me to understand the project better.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve been using this nickname for more than 10 years, but I cannot remember how I choose it.<br />
I like this nickname because it&#8217;s easy to remember, easy to pronounce, and never a duplicate with others.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I&#8217;m working in &#8220;EAGLE&#8221; Lab in Zhejiang University. I wondered what does &#8220;EAGLE&#8221; stand for, and my advisor wrote:<br />
innovativE softwAre technoloGy deveLopment cEnter</p>
<p>Then I thought my handle &#8220;yext&#8221; could be an abbreviation of &#8220;You challEnge eXtreme @ Topcoder&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Studio:  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22762979">vcsenge</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part about Studio?</strong><br />
Competition.. without long registration procedures and high fees.  Studio offers a free and simple way for everyone to show his/her creativity and to win great prices.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I liked the Univison competition series the most because we were allowed to use many photos and colorful graphic elements. This was the most creative part. But the hardest competition was the Newsweek Yahoo! Widget Competition &#8211; it is always a challenge to organize so many elements and information in such a small place.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at Studio?</strong><br />
Surprisingly, it is not to create the most creative, professional or up-to-date design but to find a look-and-feel the client likes and needs. This is the factor which makes Studio competitions so different from other competitions. The key is to find out what the client likes from the provided materials &#8211; and of course the forum help much as well.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
It comes from my name Varga Csenge.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I am only 45 kg still I shoot well with .45 pistols <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>bestbuyjoe posts over on the <a href="http://www.remixchallenge.com">Remix Challenge site</a> about some very positive results Best Buy is seeing with a couple of the apps built so far&#8230;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>As you know we started this journey between Best Buy and TopCoder earlier this year. We’ve run contests for multiple things, and two of them have been recently testing on BestBuy.com with great results!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>The Best Selling Laptop Carousel and the Mobile Phones Accessory Finder have shown very promising early results in improving the site experience for our customers. The accessory finder <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Phone-Office-Accessories/Mobile+Phone+Accessories/abcat0811002.c?id=abcat0811002">can be found here</a>. The carousel was in a test on BestBuy.com and we are examining complete results. I’ll post a link to it when it’s fully implemented.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Everyone involved should be extremely proud of what we’ve done so far. I think it’s a great representation of what can be accomplished with TopCoder.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>I’m especially looking forward to our upcoming Best Selling Widget. This will allow us to get the power of Remix into the hands of people who may not be able to develop their own solution!</em></p>
<p>Congratulations to everyone who has competed so far! For more information on taking part in the Best Buy Remix Challenge check out the <a href="http://www.remixchallenge.com">home page here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have added some automation features to Cockpit surrounding the creation of Component Design and Component Development contests.  Here is the summary:</p>
<p>1.  When creating a Component Design contest, Cockpit will ask you whether or not you want to create the corresponding Development contest at the time you save.</p>
<p>2.  If you are creating a Component Development contest separately, you will have the option to create it as &#8220;Dev Only&#8221; OR you can select an existing component that you have access to.  This will include all generic components as well as any custom components that you have access to.  The contest name field will populate with a dropdown list of matching components when you start typing.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>- Once you create a dev contest that is linked to a component, you cannot change it to Dev Only.  If you need to do this, contact components@topcoder.com</p>
<p>- Once you create a component as Dev Only, you cannot link it to another component.  If you need to do this, contact components@topcoder.com</p>

<p>This weekend we will launch a contest to implement a Yahoo! app based on a <a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewContestDetails&amp;ct=1001238">UI design</a> that is being created as we speak in TopCoder Studio (<a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewContestDetails&amp;ct=1001238">check out the design contest here</a>).  We&#8217;re excited about the contest, excited about the client and excited to see what you can do.  This widget will get a lot of attention on the Yahoo! homepage, so your work will be spotlighted in front of a huge user population. (There will also be a nice prize amount as well!)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the September coders and designers of the month.  These members did a great job last month and truly deserve this recognition. <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/news/2009/10/20/meet-the-september-coders-and-designers-of-the-month">Read their interviews.</a></p>
<p><span id="more-1219"></span><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22707974">Algorithm: kappahouse</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
Everything but the moment when I see my name suddenly disappear from the list during system test.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
&#8220;TheCardLineDivOne&#8221; and &#8220;StairsColoring&#8221;.  I still cannot solve them.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
Practice. I have been doing weekly practice competitions with nase, tomoro, rockey, s2k, yomura and taxmul, through which I was able to improve my skill.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
Comes from my nickname when I was in junior high school.  &#8220;Kappa&#8221; is a Japanese legendary creature.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
Unfortunately, there is nothing surprising about me.  If you still want to know something about me, I want to boast that I made my first successful challenge at my 42nd SRM last time.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10437190&amp;tab=des">Design: caru</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/caru1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1221" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/caru1.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em>Here is caru in his home town of Livigno, Italy.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
I can live and travel where I really want and work when I like to. When I awake, I can decide when and how much I am gonna work. That&#8217;s cool!</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Lynx Calendar Facebook Manager component design. I had to study a lot, and the project was a little more complex than the others I did in the last month.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
Precision: usually that&#8217;s enough to win. Too many times positions are decided by distraction mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
Very simple: my surname is Caruso and many friends call me caru.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
Sometimes I am tempted to use my time to compete in Studio, because I feel a little more relaxed when dealing with graphics. I tried a few times without success (though I have to say that I didn&#8217;t do my best <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> , so I will stick to the TC side for now. Maybe in the future&#8230;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=14882871&amp;tab=dev">Development:  pulky</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pulky.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1222" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pulky.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
My favorite part of TopCoder is the TCO… I’ve been to Vegas several times and had so much fun. Hopefully I will be able to travel there next year.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
The difficulty was not primarily in the projects but in the decisions. It was pretty hard to decide which contest to commit to and be sure a good submission was feasible. I was very careful because I wanted to keep my reliability but sometimes going for the DR while keeping your reliability 100% is too hard.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
I never submit a solution that I don’t think is really, really good. This is not a good advice since it’s often “bad for business” (sometimes good enough is better), but this is mainly my strategy. I like to win, complete final fixes within 10 minutes and be ready to focus in a new competition.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
My handle has been my nickname forever… I don’t even remember why people started calling me pulky the first time <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
Since there were no big checks in the last TCO and I wanted mine, I “forced” Jessie (being annoying enough) to write it down for me and had Laurie (Facebook) pose for the picture <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  (see above)</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewMemberProfile&amp;ha=ujazz">Studio: ujazz</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ujazz.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1223" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ujazz.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part about Studio?</strong><br />
The results. They are unpredictable. Once I submitted work with a lot of creative ideas and good quality, and I thought about getting in the upper places but in the end I did not even make first 5.  I think only to make projects with the best quality and have some fresh ideas.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Design the storyboard for Insurance Town was hardest project. There was much work on details and concept was needed.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at Studio?</strong><br />
Do everything or do something new. Research before start. Look  at  best world ideas. Just start the project. Make more than one version. Have critical views to all things. Submit proper submissions to current contest not to else one like me <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
My handle is pronounced like horror in Russian. Why? See next.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I played at local melodic death-metal band as front man – guitarist and growl-singer. m/</p>

<hr />From the <a href="http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&amp;threadID=653101">forums</a> announcement:<br />
 </p>
<h2>Announcing the $20,000 NASA-TopCoder Challenge!</h2>
<p>We are very excited to offer you a chance to solve an important problem given to us by NASA&#8217;s Space Life Sciences Directorate. This 10-day marathon match will run from November 4 &#8211; November 14, 2009.</p>
<p>This is a historical opportunity to bring the creativity of the TopCoder community to the space program. The solutions developed will have the potential to have a direct impact on future human space flights organized by NASA and its partners. The winners of the competition can proudly state that they have had a real impact on human space flight.</p>
<p>The significance of this opportunity is further enhanced by the unique prizes we offering:</p>
<p>*<strong>A LARGE CASH PRIZE POOL</strong>. The total prize pool for this contest is $20,000.</p>
<p>*<strong>EXCLUSIVE VIP INVITATION TO NASA SHUTTLE LAUNCH FOR TOP SUBMISSIONS</strong>. 6 participants will get VIP access to one of the few remaining NASA shuttle launches. (Note: Winners will have to make their own way to the Kennedy Space Center for the launch.)</p>
<p>*<strong>A LIMITED EDITION NASA-TOPCODER T-SHIRT &#8211; WITH YOUR NAMES</strong>. We will print a limited number of TopCoder-NASA t-shirts for every single active participant in the contest. The handles of each and every active participant in the event will be written on the t-shirt.</p>
<p>We are also using this event as an opportunity to experiment with our platform to try to learn key lessons for how to improve and evolve in the future. We are working closely with researchers at Harvard Business School, London Business School and MLab. This will bring several unique features to the contest, which we hope drives a high level of participation &#8211; and also a diverse group of participants.</p>
<p>*1 IN 4 PARTICIPANTS CAN WIN CASH PRIZES: We are designing the contest in a way so that 1 in 4 participants will be eligible for the cash prize. Instead of the usual competing against the masses ? competition will be limited to virtual rooms of 20 individuals competing for a prize of $1,000/room. Five people in each room will be able to take partake in the cash prizes.</p>
<p>*SOME COMPETING IN TEAMS: Based on the feedback from the last experiment, we will have some competition rooms that will be team-based. In this situation in each group of 20 participants there will be 4 teams of five individuals competing to win the $1000 prize.</p>
<p>*LIMITED PARTICIPATION: We will limit the contest to 480 participants. We encourage all current, past and new members to participate. In the case of overwhelming demand, priority will be given to members with pre-existing TopCoder ratings (regardless of competition type).</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/news/2009/10/01/interview-with-nvidia-cuda-superheros-iquadrat-and-b285714">Read Interviews.</a></p>
<p><span id="more-1201"></span></p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> How does it feel to win the NVIDIA CUDA Superhero challenge? Can<br />
you explain how you approached solving the problem?</p>
<p><strong>Iquadrat:</strong> It feels great to be one of the winners of the NVIDIA CUDA Superhero<br />
Challenge! It comes to me a bit as surprise as I started exploring CUDA only in the second week of the contest. I had heard of it before but never got the chance to try it out myself.</p>
<p>In the first week, I explored some different algorithms to attack the CCL problem on the CPU only. Finally, I found the find-and-union algorithm most suitable as it needed only a single pass over all<br />
neighbor relations. It works as following: Initially each pixel is assigned to a separate set (with its index as id of the set) by assigning itself as parent. Then, the pixels sets were joined according to the neighboring relation. The joining of two pixel sets was done by finding the ids of the pixels (the pixel that has itself as parent) and then making the pixel with the larger id the child of the pixel with the smaller child. In a final step, the set id is looked up for each pixel and written to the result array. On the CPU, this could already be calculated pretty fast using SIMD instructions to compute the neighboring relations. My fastest CPU-only version scored a bit over 13,000 points.</p>
<p>In week two, I explored the CUDA framework. On Monday I decided to buy a GTX 260 card as my laptop card did not support all the instructions I wanted to use. The most runtime consuming task was getting the data onto the GPU and from there back into the host memory. The copy time was more than the calculation time itself. I did not manage to interlave the data transfer with the computation on the GPU as this would have needed pinned memory. Copying the input vector to pinned memory first<br />
wasn’t an option as this took too much time to be a benefit afterwards.</p>
<p>My algorithm for the GPU was very similar to the one on the CPU:</p>
<p>1) Copy the data to GPU.<br />
2) Divide the image into 44&#215;44 blocks. Each kernel copies its part of<br />
the image into shared memory, then solves the CCL for this part.<br />
3) Join the solved CCLs from the second step along the seams of the<br />
blocks in the graphic card&#8217;s global memory.<br />
4) Final pass, look up the final index of the pixels.<br />
5) Copy the data back to host memory.</p>
<p>Because the pixel sets were joined concurrently, I used atomic instructions to prevent race conditions. So, the find-and-union for two pixels repeatedly tries to join the sets until it succeeds. The GPU solution scored about 38000 points on the intermediate tests, so it was about three times faster then the CPU algorithm, despite the overhead of copying the data form the CPU to the GPU and back.</p>
<p>Approx time distribution: Step 1 30%, Step 2 20%, Step 3 15%, Step 4 5%, Step 5 30%.</p>
<p>One of the main problems was the instability of the testing environment.  Solutions sometimes failed test cases without apparent reasons. Because of this, it was very difficult to say if a failing test was because of a bug in the solution or an issue with the tester or hardware.</p>
<p><strong>b285714: </strong>The CUDA superhero challenge brought me an excitement I haven&#8217;t felt for a long time. It feels great to compete with talented programmers world-wide.</p>
<p>I solved the problem by trying a lot of different alternatives to find the fastest one. This is achieved using BSGP, a high level GPU programming language built on top of CUDA hardware. The built in parallel primitives like reduce/compact helped a great deal in gathering optimization information.</p>
<p>I wrote all my submission entries in BSGP and hand translated them to CUDA for submission.</p>
<p><strong>TC: </strong>What did you learn about CUDA from this competition?</p>
<p><strong>Iquadrat:</strong> I learned much about the CUDA framework and the computation power of the<br />
NVIDIA graphic cards as well as about the CCL problem and different ways to solve it.</p>
<p><strong>b285714: </strong>A lot of new performance tricks, especially when dealing with large data.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Would you recommend this series to others?</p>
<p><strong>Iquadrat:</strong> Apart from the instability of the testing environment, the contest was very much fun! Therefore, I recommend the series to everybody who is interested in really massive parallel algorithms and unleashing the power of contemporary  graphic cards &#8212; and already owns a GTX 260 or higher graphic card which is really needed to get exact timing results and get the most optimized code.</p>
<p><strong>b285714:</strong> Surely yes.</p>
<p><strong>TC: </strong>What advice would you give to other TopCoder members?</p>
<p><strong>Iquadrat:</strong> Try a bunch of different algorithms, keep attention to the TopCoder forums and never give up <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>b285714:</strong> Try BSGP:) It would help your GPU programming experience.</p>
<p>Remember, the second NVIDIA CUDA Superhero Challenge competition starts November 23, 2009 so get practicing!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the August Coders and Designers of the month!  Check out their <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/news/2009/09/14/meet-the-august-coders-and-designers-of-the-month">interviews</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-1183"></span><strong>Algorithm: rockaustin2k6</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/p1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1184" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/p1.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
SRMs are what I have only competed in TopCoder and i like them the most. Just before the arrival of the active contest, thousands of coders group together in TopCoder chat rooms, have fun talking to one another, and then the 1 hour 15 minutes of coding(with live summary of submissions) and finally, the challenge round (which I have never performed well). I find it highly interactive way of gaining knowledge as compared to contests of various Online Judges and others&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I spent last month with few level 3 problems of division 1 related to graphs, level 2 problems of division2 related to Dynamic Programming and some questions of acm uva online judge related to Maths.Division 1 level 3 problems are the hardest and i touched them first that month. I could still remember the problem related to Euler cycles of <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&amp;pm=1649">SRM 144 division 1 hard</a> and  my dp solution related to lcm for <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&amp;pm=1135">SRM 160 division 1 hard</a>.</p>
<p>The trickier lcm problem was that given an integer S (S&lt;=52), you needed to decompose it into several integers (&gt;=1) such that sum of them is equal to S and their lcm is maximum. Going with the obvious recursion of single state { f(s) = for all 1&lt;=i&lt;=s max(lcm(i,f(s-i)) }, was giving a wrong answer. This was to be done carefully to avoid wrong answers (they are what I hate most).</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
I think speed with accuracy (getting least debugging and logical errors) and little bit of typing speed matters most.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
Coding is fun. I find TopCoder very attractive and interactive but came to know about it so late (after high school). What I am now is because of my hard work, contributions of my brother imrankane2005 and seniors (fameoflight,R0N,humblefool)[All TopCoder handles], batch mates, present study conditions of my college(IIIT Allahabad), highly encouraging Sanjeev Sir (faculty member of the college,Assistant Professor) and, of course, my parents.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you?</strong><br />
I am the follower of islam yet don&#8217;t (can&#8217;t) eat meat.</p>
<p><strong>Design:  viviz</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
Competition makes software design more interesting, and you can discuss your solution with all the designers/deveopers from all over the world, you can improve your skills, it&#8217;s exciting.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I believe there are no easy competitions. Every competition is hard.</p>
<p>The hardest part of each project is the REQUIREMENT Specification is unclear, we need to talk with Architecture/PM for more details with much more time.</p>
<p>And as a non-native english speaker, it&#8217;s hard to writing Component specifiaction and UML documentation without any spelling/grammar errors.That&#8217;s why I always got punishment in scorecard  4.1.6</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
You should read each part of RS very carefully, each requirement listed in Logic Requirement should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>After you get a general solution of your design, you need to consider the corner of each algorithm AND<br />
public API configuration elements.  The exception is handling dependency components etc.</p>
<p>Addtionally, make your design very flexible is also important. Then write your detailed documentation.  Don&#8217;t forget to provide a comprehensible demo in CS for both reviewer/developer to understand the usage of your component: e.g.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a WCF Service component, you&#8217;d better provide a about how to generate client, how to host your service, how to access WCF service via Client.  If it&#8217;s a windows service component, you&#8217;d better provide a demo how to install/uninstall the service.  For any Demo part, you should provide sample input and discuss what&#8217;s the expected behavior of each Demo action. The one word is</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
vivi is my english name, I use the first character of my family &#8220;zhang&#8221;, so it&#8217;s viviz. No special story^^</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
Seems no special thing makes me surprising&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Development:  snow01</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
Everything, I am involved in =). Prizes, DR Points, DR Ranking, Assembly Competitions.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I think the Cockpit Release 4 assembly. I spent almost 24 hours on <a href="http://https//www.topcoder.com/bugs/browse/BUGR-2119">one single bugr</a> &#8211; just to fix it with 2 lines of code. Obviously the fix required me to read the code of flex sdk.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
1) Pick a specific area and stick to that &#8211; like I picked &#8220;cockpit&#8221; assemblies. After 1-2 competitions, you would be having edge than anybody else. There are contests which others would finish in 3-4 days and I have taken only 4-6 hours to finish.</p>
<p>2) Reviewer comments are quite important too. Even if your submission is half complete, do the submission &#8211; it is going to give some learning for next contest.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
&#8220;snow&#8221; is nick name of my beloved.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I love watching a lot of movies, lot of sleep and lot of work. Surprisingly it is hard to fit all 3 in a single day, even any 2 too =).</p>
<p><strong>Studio:  djackmania</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part about Studio?</strong><br />
Being a winner.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Ferguson.com &#8220;Professional&#8221; iPhone Application, I finished the project &#8220;outdoor&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at Studio?</strong><br />
Passion, passion, passion.. and push to the limit&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
The fans (mania) of my nickname in the Old Javanese spelling (d+jack)</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I&#8217;m not a graphic or web designer, I&#8217;m an electrical engineer <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past year, the TopCoder membership has designed and built a highly structured, robust medical records application called EHR.  This application is used by a large children&#8217;s hospital and childhood disease research center to track the care and treatment of their patients.  Patients of this center typically see many providers in several clinics on a single visit &#8211; for example a physician, a physical therapist, and a nutritionist &#8211; and as the campus is very large, this application is crucial for centralizing medical information.</p>
<p>The winning components and assemblies have been assembled and integrated, but we are not quite finished.  There are several updates, additions and changes to make before the application can be used.  Fortunately, none of them are new &#8211; all are more of what&#8217;s been done already.  Therefore we have split the work into 30+ bite-sized portions, which are together worth nearly $2,000.  Some tasks are trivial, some are larger, some are mere SQL and others require Facelets experience.  None require more than a few hours.  And all are grouped together by skill &#8211; so if you enjoyed one task, you can find several more exactly like it attached to the same ticket.  Work on as many or few tasks as you like &#8211; or as you can squeeze in during commercials!</p>
<p>Pre-configured Virtual Machines are available for working on these tickets.</p>
<p>For more information, use the <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/bugs/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&amp;requestId=10769">public BUGR filter</a> , or contact axiom, restarter, or bchops.</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&amp;threadID=650947&amp;mc=1#1142045">Discuss this topic in the forums here.</a></p>
<p>Good luck and thank you!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TopCoder is excited to announce the AgentMatching Marathon Match!</p>
<p>TopCoder has a customer that needs your help. They are looking for an algorithm to better predict which of their real estate agents will successfully close a property with prospective customers. The client has provided historical data consisting of thousands of agent &#8211; customer pairings. One of the key challenges to this problem is that it may take up to seven months for the agent to close the real estate deal. Thus, this problem will require you to develop novel machine learning techniques accounting for the fact that the training data contains real estate leads which will be closed in the future.</p>
<p>Whoever is able to predict which leads will be closed will walk away with the $2,500 prize! You have until Thursday, August 27, 2009 at 1:00 p.m. EDT (UTC/GMT -4) to fine tune your solution.</p>
<p>Check out the AgentMatching problem statement <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=ViewProblemStatement&amp;compid=9593&amp;rd=13934">here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the July Coders and Designers of the month! Enjoy their <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/news/2009/08/13/meet-the-july-coders-and-designers-of-the-month">interviews</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-1150"></span></p>
<p><strong>Algorithm: tourist</strong><br />
<strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tourist.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1151" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tourist.jpg" alt="" width="222" height="300" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
Competition! The spirit of competition is what I really love. It&#8217;s amazing when you can compare yourself with the best coders all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Last month I just prepared for IOI 2009 at our training camp. But, if speaking about problems&#8230; it was difficult for me to settle my nerves when I saw that my rating is 2999 <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
You must code everything correctly, but also fast enough. Usually practice helps to achieve that all.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
Oh&#8230; I don&#8217;t actually remember that. I was about 11 when I first registered with this handle.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
My favourite programming language is Pascal. I can code better and faster in Pascal, and I&#8217;m usually coding in C++ just for TopCoder or when I need to use STL in my code. Maybe the problem is that Pascal is my &#8216;native&#8217; language <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Design: hpana</strong><br />
<strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
The ability to choose the work is the greatest. I didn&#8217;t have this ability at any of my jobs.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I only participated in a few specification contests. The hardest and largest up to now was PPM Operations Administrator Module Specification. By the time I finished it I was dreaming activity diagrams.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
Working hard and from the beginning is the most important factor.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s the concatenation of my name and the company that I work for.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I have a Phd in chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Development: gjw99<br />
What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
Getting practiced in different technologies/frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Writing a purchase order related design for my company&#8217;s portal.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
Take an all-round view of the project and be careful.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
&#8220;gjw&#8221; is the abbreviation for my name. 99 is the year my grandfather died.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
My head is big -_-</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cci.mit.edu/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1115 alignright" style="margin: 8px 10px" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/logo_mit-cci.gif" alt="" width="229" height="56" /></a></p>
<p>Many people believe that global climate change is one of the most important problems currently facing humanity. If we don&#8217;t solve this problem, our other problems may not matter much, because we may not be here to have them. Left to their own devices, scientists, journalists, politicians, businesses, and consumers will certainly do something about this problem. But the inefficiencies, delays, and distortions of traditional mass media, political decision-making, markets, and scientific publication mean that the results will almost certainly not be as good as we might hope.</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, in just the last decade or so, a new way of solving global problems has become possible. Examples like Wikipedia, Linux, and of course TopCoder, illustrate how it&#8217;s now possible to combine the work of many in ways that would have been impossible only a few years ago.</p>
<p><span id="more-1110"></span></p>
<p>We believe this new approach can be used to help solve the problem of global climate change, and our goal is to create the platform for doing so. We seek to develop a global, on-line community—called the Climate Collaboratorium—in which thousands of people around the world will create, analyze, and ultimately select detailed plans for what we humans can do about global climate change. Together, the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence and the global community of TopCoder are going to build this platform.</p>
<p>The first step is the <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProjectDetail&amp;pj=30007102">conceptualization contest</a>, which is running right now. Then, the MIT Climate Collaboratorium moves through the TopCoder process, providing you the opportunity to compete on multiple contests both for prize money, and for something more.</p>
<p>If the project is successful in its grandest ambitions, it will lead to the creation in a few years of a societal institution that is comparable to (though perhaps somewhat smaller than) Wikipedia. It will be an on-line community used routinely by scientists, politicians, journalists, and anyone with a professional interest in climate change. It will be a standard resource for educators, students, and any citizens who want to learn about climate change. And it will be a place where any citizens who care can either express their opinions about climate change directly, or delegate their &#8220;proxy&#8221; to others who will vote on their behalf. In short, it could become a combination of a kind of simulation game for climate change, a Wikipedia for controversial topics, and an electronic democracy on steroids.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t do it alone, but we think we might have a pretty good shot with your help.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the June Coders and Designers of the Month!  TopCoder interviewed the winners so enjoy the conversations!</p>
<p><span id="more-1090"></span><strong>Alogrithm: knightry</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/stephen_viking.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1091" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/stephen_viking.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><em>This picture is from the ICPC Finals from Sweden this year, where knightry&#8217;s group won a competition at one of the events and they all got those sweet viking helmets.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
Definitely the great selection of problems in all the practice rooms. I love going to a practice room and trying to complete the set as if I were in a real contest, then seeing where I would have placed if I had actually competed. It&#8217;s also great having the ability to see how tricky problems can be solved by referring to the editorial or other code in the practice room. It&#8217;s a really good system you guys have set up to learn new things.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m helping my advisor with a new quantum algorithm he&#8217;s developing for the discrete logarithm problem, but at every new thing I learned, I found 10 more things in abstract algebra I needed to understand first. For the first couple weeks, it felt like trying to learn to swim in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
The ability to analyze a problem and strip away the non-essentials. TopCoder problem writers are good at masking problems behind clever stories, and you have to know how to break a problem apart to determine which strategy should be used at the appropriate time.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
My school mascot is the Knights, so a few years ago I was looking for a new email address. I had 2 criteria: 1) It involved the word knight and 2) it didn&#8217;t have any numbers. After a few tries on gmail, I found one I liked that wasn&#8217;t taken, and since then I&#8217;ve been using it everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I love to play sports, which I find is a bit uncommon for people in computer science. My current favorite is ultimate frisbee, though I really enjoy tennis and golf, too. I was also on the men&#8217;s rowing team as an undergraduate.</p>
<p><strong>Development: Yeung</strong><br />
<strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
To know more people from different country, to learn more techniques, and most important is to earn money.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
SP-14 Card Event Client Service 1.0. I never see any component has so many pending issues before submission.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
Be careful in details.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
No story. It is my name.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I want to shave my head bald. It is too hot now.</p>
<p><strong>Studio: iamtong</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/iamtong.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1092" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/iamtong.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part about Studio?</strong><br />
Honestly, seeing my handle when the winners are announced!</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project you worked on last month?</strong><br />
No projects are easy here! For last month, my hardest project was &#8220;REMIX Challenge : Mobile Phones Website Tournament&#8221;! As 2 of my submissions got past R1, I had to finish both for R2, but spent most of my time designing 2 sets of different 3d icons to use in each design, when there were 5 pages to work on for each design. I ended up with nothing because I failed to submit for R2. T-T</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at Studio?</strong><br />
A good understanding of the project, some research, offer a client as much of a solution as you can, and a bit of luck!</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
I am &#8220;Tong&#8221; &#8211; my nickname.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I studied computer engineering, I should be over on the other side, but I love being here &#8211; in the Studio <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of the new Ferguson.com, TopCoder has launched an Idea Generation contest to let you, the members, come up with the best way to match potential customers to their home décor style.  We have several excellent ideas submitted so far and we&#8217;d like to gather several more before the contest ends tomorrow.  So, in addition to the current $500/$250/$250 prize structure, we&#8217;re now offering two bonus payments:</p>
<p>1) $100 to the most original idea &#8211; Think outside the box.  Come up with something unique.  Even if it&#8217;s not a top 3 winner, we want to reward you for your creativity.</p>
<p>2) $150 to the most complete submission &#8211; Idea Generation contests are simply that: ideas.  However, the more detail you can provide the closer we are to being able to implement that idea.  Aspects of ‘completeness&#8217; here might include a fully explained concept, details such as benefits, risks, future direction, etc, a rough UI design, and any calculations or algorithms that might be needed.</p>
<p>Please check out the competition here:<br />
<a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewContestDetails&amp;ct=1001006" target="_self"><span style="color: #800000">http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewContestDetails&amp;ct=1001006</span></a></p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the May Coders and Designers of the Month! TopCoder took a minute to ask them all a few questions so enjoy their interviews.</p>
<p><span id="more-1071"></span>,<strong>Algorithm: wrong</strong><br />
<strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
I participate in some algorithm competitions and most of their forms like ICPC.  But TopCoder&#8217;s SRM is not. TopCoder&#8217;s SRM&#8217;s form is original.  I like SRM and its originality <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I think the hardest problem is &#8220;MazeWandering&#8221; in SRM 440 Div1 Medium. First, I was positive that the maze is graph and is not tree.  At that time, I couldn&#8217;t solve the problem in Coding Phase.  Later, I realized that the maze was tree.  But I couldn&#8217;t solve the problem without the other coder&#8217;s help.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
I think that the most important thing is not to make trifling mistakes.  I often make trifling mistakes.  Because of this, I sometimes get &#8220;Wrong Answer&#8221; or &#8220;Failed System Test&#8221;  for easy problems.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
Like I said before, I sometimes get &#8220;Wrong Answer&#8221; by trifling mistakes.  Not to repeat a mistake, I decided to name my handle &#8220;wrong&#8221;.  So I can check if I make a trifling mistake when I saw my handle.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I&#8217;m 16-year-old high school student in Japan, and I&#8217;m studying English at school.  Now I&#8217;m writing these sentences with a dictionary.  You may be surprised by poorness of these sentences :-] Someday I will  surprise you by speaking English fluently!</p>
<p><strong>Design: saarixx</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/saarixx-grand_canyon.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1073" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/saarixx-grand_canyon.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><em>saarixx at the Grand Canyon after the TCO</em></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
When I compete in design competitions full time, I like that my earnings are proportional to spent time and effort. And I know that I will get a reward for each hour additionally spent on work.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
This was Preference Center Admin Publication Services design. I can&#8217;t remember when I drew such large class diagrams before <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
IMHO, the main factor is time spent on exploring solutions provided by winners of previous competitions. This is applicable to most types of competitions: Marathon, Algorithm, Design, Conceptualization, Architecture, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
My initials are SAA. I added RIX to them just to make it sound cool and funny, with no exact meaning. Then I googled for SAARIX and found that it&#8217;s not unique in the world wide web. To make it unique I added addition X to the end. Thus my handle is SAARIXX, and if you find some web page with word &#8220;SAARIXX&#8221; &#8211; be sure it&#8217;s about me <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Development: isv</strong><br />
<strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
I like competing in SRMs and assembly competitions. The former bring real fun and the the latter provide good expirience with building the applications. I also like reading forums which give a good grasp of what the TopCoder community is, what are the new initiatives from the company, whether they are successful or not and so on. Watching how the community and the company evolve is really interesting.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve been working on assembly competitions for a single project mostly and the main problem was resolving various inconsistencies between requirements, components, prototypes which were introduced at various stages of the project.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
In short, have a plan for solving the problem and be fast and accurate when implementing that plan.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
This is just acronym for my full name.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I bought my first PC at the age of 28.</p>
<p><strong>Studio: Trial_and_Error</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/paul_palawan.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1072" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/paul_palawan.jpg" alt="" width="197" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part about Studio?</strong><br />
Not to mention the financial reward, Topcoder had really helped me enhance my design skills and build up my self-belief. Winning is definitely not easy here because I know I’m competing with a lot of talented designers around the world. But the moment you see your name being selected as winner, there’s a different feeling of pride. Now that’s priceless.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project you worked on last month?</strong><br />
Without blinking an eye, I’d say it’s the “A Day in the Life – Flash Animation Contest” . I just thought that the time is very limited for me because I also have a day job to attend, and could only work for my submission as soon as I get home. But I’m really determined to win so I just sacrificed some sleep just to get through it.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at Studio?</strong><br />
Understanding the client’s requirement is a very essential factor to start right in the competition. Yeah at first you’ll get rejection, but make sure you learn from those mistakes to be able to deliver a better design the next time.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
Nothing serious &#8211; it was just the first thing that came to my mind because initially everything was just a trial for me &#8212; if I’m gonna be successful in every competition.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I play the guitar and I’m a frustrated rockstar.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the April Coders and Designers of the Month!  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/news/2009/05/26/meet-the-april-coders-and-designers-of-the-month/">Check out their interviews.</a></p>
<p><span id="more-997"></span><strong>Algorithm: Radient</strong><br />
<img class="size-medium wp-image-999 alignnone" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/tc_radient.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
There are a lot of algorithm competitions in the world, but only TopCoder’s SRM has a peculiar step it called ‘challenge phase’. I think it’s so good for me. I sometimes take a mistake in my programming codes unexpectedly, but I seldom or never check it again. TopCoder makes me think again and write codes carefully. And it also gives me a chance to read the other coder’s programming code. It’s a perfect textbook of algorithm and coding skills.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
“Palindrome Phrases” in Single Round Match 439 on 30th, April. I took a close look at this problem and thought once and again. In fact, I already experienced some problems that was similar to this problem, but I cannot still understand this problem type.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
Actually, I’ve never been a winner of the competition. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  But I think that to solve the problem without any mistake is extremely important. Even if someone solves a problem soon, if that solution has just a mere mistake, finally it spends lots of time for correction. To make a perfect solution all at once is so hard, but it will be powerful weapon in a competition, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
When I was in a middle school, I was absorbed in play a card game it called ‘Magic: the Gathering’. In that game, there was a card it named ‘Radiant, the archangel’ and I liked that card so much. Therefore when I decided to make a handle for TopCoder, I recollected that card’s name. But I couldn’t know its name exactly. After all, my handle had been ‘Radient’ not ‘Radiant’. Yes, it was just a typographical error. Nevertheless, I love my handle name so much. It’s so unique, isn’t it? <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I’m Korean, but I’m now here in Osaka, Japan. I had been studying in a foreign country since April, 2009. So I was ranked in Korea as well as Osaka University in Japan. ‘April’ is a word with two meanings for me. The one is beginning to study in a foreign country, and the other is being an algorithm coder of the month in TopCoder!</p>
<p><strong>Design: Bramandia<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/s4031207.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1000 alignnone" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/s4031207.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
As a designer, my favorite part is to think about the design, e.g. what the classes should be, what design patterns to use, how each class interacts one another, etc. I also enjoy the drawing part, e.g. interacting with the UML Tool <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?</strong><br />
I think the hardest project was &#8220;Budget Stacker Consumer Survey Management v1.0&#8243; in which the requirements were not clear. This requires many clarifications in the forum.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
An important factor is not to be afraid of losing. There might be 2 or 3 or even more good designers registered for the same design. Just go on, don&#8217;t afraid to lose, consider winning/losing as a natural part of the process. At worst, we could learn from the winning submission.</p>
<p>I guess determination is the next factor. As a software designer, we need to read the requirements, understand them, ask questions if necessary, finally we need to submit a working design. These need a lot of efforts. Determination would help us to struggle till the deadline <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>
<p>As we go along, experience matters a lot since it allows us to work more efficiently and allows me to do more design in the same period of time.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
There is no story about it. It is simply my first name which happens to be pretty much uncommon. It might be unique across the globe, but I don&#8217;t claim that <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.</strong><br />
I am Indonesian, married and expected to have a child soon. Hopefully this is surprising enough <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>
<p><strong>Development:  elkhawajah</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of TopCoder?</strong><br />
Competiton ( I love the thrill of it ) <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project or problem you worked on last month?<br />
</strong>none <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  All of the projects I worked on fall in my field of expertise.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at TopCoder?</strong><br />
It is the ability to deal with adrenaline/fear/euphoria that goes into competing.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
No special story behind my handle, it is my surname <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.<br />
</strong>I hate computers!</p>
<p><strong>Studio: djnapier</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_3770_1_smallweb1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1001 alignnone" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_3770_1_smallweb1.jpg" alt="" width="213" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part about Studio?</strong><br />
Apart from the obvious benefit of Studio (the opportunity to earn serious money), my favourite part is knowing that the work I do is valued by the client. Having them select your work out of many entries gives a great sense of confidence and pride in the work that you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p><strong>What was the hardest project you worked on last month?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s a tie between two projects – both were hard for very different reasons:<br />
1) A website storyboard project with 8 pages of layout to be done. It was hard because maintaining a consistent style across many pages, can be hard to do, especially in a conceptual space where you sometimes come up with a nicer solution halfway through the project and have to readjust what you&#8217;ve already done. However the reward on this project was worth it.</p>
<p>2) It was nearing the end of the competition window for TCO and I was hovering at the bottom of the top 10. There were a few smaller jobs where I had to step back and say &#8216;This really needs my attention and focus otherwise I&#8217;ll never get there&#8217;. Normally on small jobs, not a lot of time goes into planning and researching them, but if I didn&#8217;t put in effort and it turned out I needed to on these projects, I would have regretted it.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the most important factor to win a competition at Studio?</strong><br />
I think the important thing is to realise that you&#8217;re not designing for you, you&#8217;re designing for someone else. Sure you can influence the style, but always think of what the client is trying to convey. Also, any feedback you receive is really important – take it in, apply it, and then use it as a springboard for refined and fantastic design.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind your handle?</strong><br />
Nothing too special – just my initials and my last name. I feel that having a handle like &#8216;coolguy45&#8242; is great and I understand privacy, but it misses a big opportunity to market yourself. I think it makes users a bit more approachable, taking down that digital wall.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us one surprising thing about you.<br />
</strong>Oh there&#8217;s a few surprising things about me – I can lick my left elbow, but not my right (apparently &#8220;impossible&#8221; to do); I was born with a sixth finger on my left pinky (no bone, but it had a fingernail! – was removed at birth but still have the scar to show) &amp; I can balance objects on my nose. Circus Freakshow – where do I sign up? <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':-D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TopCoder is working with <a href="http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2009/05/writing-a-book-by-competition.html">O&#8217;Reilly Media</a> to develop a  <a href="http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Announcement&amp;annID=1547">&#8220;Cookbook&#8221; about TopCoder</a>, describing the problems &amp; techniques used by TopCoder members when participating in the various types of TopCoder competitions, and who better to write it than the members of the TopCoder community itself?</p>
<p>The first stage is an open call to the TopCoder members to create draft &#8220;recipes&#8221; for the TopCoder Cookbook. Each recipe describes a solution to a problem frequently encountered by TopCoder members when participating in a TopCoder competition. This can include – but is not limited to &#8211; use of tools, competition formats, process, navigating the web sites, or common types of competition submissions, patterns, requirements, and so on. Any issue that you have encountered and solved when competing on TopCoder could be the subject of a recipe.</p>
<p>Credit will be given to recipe ideas accepted into the book, as well as a portion of the author payments, as described in the <a href="../../wiki/display/tc/TopCoder+Cookbook">TopCoder Cookbook project description</a>.</p>
<p>TopCoder and O&#8217;Reilly are both very excited about this experiment, and hope that many of you will join the effort. <a href="http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Announcement&amp;annID=1547"></a></p>

<p>Facebook is hiring brilliant engineers who like to build. Because we&#8217;re growing so quickly, there is enormous opportunity for individuals to have an impact and to grow as our service and our company grows. What matters here is what you contribute, not your credentials.</p>
<p>No one has ever done what we are trying to do at such speed and scale, and we do it all with less than two hundred engineers. Our active user to engineer ratio is over 1,000,000:1&#8230; and growing, and you just won&#8217;t get that personal impact at any other company.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got 200 million users around the world so far, but we have so much more to do and build&#8230; and that&#8217;s where your kung fu comes into play. Come build with us, we&#8217;re hiring.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=tournaments&amp;d2=tco09&amp;d3=overview&amp;d4=sponsors&amp;d5=sponsor3">Apply here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to our March Coders and Designers of the Month! TopCoder sat down to interview these honored members and we hope you enjoy!</p>
<p><span id="more-750"></span><strong>Algorithm: dkorduban</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/dscf3880-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-753" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/dscf3880-1.jpg" alt="" width="187" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em>Here is dkorduban at SEERC&#8217;2006</em></p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m very pleased.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
Can&#8217;t say I have one particular hobby. Besides math-related stuff I like reading, different outdoor activities and a whole bunch of small fun pastimes. Say, collecting sugar packets or paper folding.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
Quick-Typical-DP-Problem-Solving-Skill, if consider ACM-style competitions as other area of my life. More seriously, I&#8217;ve learned to follow KISS principle as often as possible. It really helps in many areas.</p>
<p>Design: <strong>Standlove</strong></p>
<p><strong>What brought you to TopCoder?</strong><br />
I originally competed in the ACM contests, after I am retired, I heard TopCoder from WishingBone.<br />
At that time, I was still interested in the algorithm contests and still had the passion to improve my skills, but after doing a couple of contests at TopCoder, my passion faded away and I felt that I would probably never be good at it.</p>
<p>Later I switched to the Component contests, and it turns out that I can live an independent life by doing it.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s not the first time for me to be the Coder of the Month. But this time is probably because of the architecture competitions I won.<br />
So it&#8217;s still a new experience to me, and I am glad that I come back with some new skills that I have learned in the last few months.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
Read and Think. I&#8217;m not quite good at it actually, but I am enjoying it more and more, and I think I&#8217;m improving on it too, though very slowly.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
Sometimes after I submit my submission, I think my submission is perfect.<br />
But after the review results comes out, it turns out that the reviewers don&#8217;t agree with me at all.</p>
<p>In the beginning, it was really a tough time for me to open the review cards and do the appeals.<br />
I got nervous and sometimes even angry about it, but after years of competing, I gradually start to take it easy.</p>
<p>And I start to take it easy too when I see people having different views or life styles than mine in my other areas of life.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, I am not quite sure whether I learned it from my TopCoder life or my other areas of life, but I think I only have one life here, and I don&#8217;t really need to cut it into two parts.</p>
<p>Development: <strong>pinoydream</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/after-f1-race.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-752" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/after-f1-race.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p><em>Here is pinoydream after the Formula 1 Race in Singapore, in September 2008.  TopCoder paid for that!</em></p>
<p><strong>What brought you to TopCoder?</strong><br />
My friends introduced me to TopCoder (Thanks to them! <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  ) and around Feb of 2007, I registered and ever since I&#8217;ve been joining competitions on my spare time. What keeps me going is the challenge of every contest and the reward that you receive from it.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month?<br />
</strong>It feels great! Nice to know that hard work pays off.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
Besides TopCoder, I play basketball, computer games, and hanging out with friends. I&#8217;m also a photography hobbyist.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
No pain, no gain. <img src='http://community.topcoder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Studio: <strong>billow</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/00223.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-755" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/00223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong></p>
<p><em>Billow at Grand View Garden in Beijing.</em></p>
<p><strong>What brought you to Studio?</strong><br />
A friend sent me a link to a studio contest (a logo contest) and I submited one and became &#8220;cannon fodder&#8221;. Not a good start point, but I still went on because I like creative jobs!</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Designer of the Month?</strong><br />
It was really great. Wow~ hard to believe! Thanks, fellows!</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides Studio?</strong><br />
Favorite? That must be watching videos on youtube!</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at Studio that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
I think it&#8217;s &#8220;Detail makes difference&#8221;. Sometimes the whole design is good but not enough. It&#8217;s the detail that make things perfect.</p>

<p>Registration is now open for the Experimental Marathon Series! Cash prizes and trips to the <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tco09">2009 TopCoder(R) Open</a> are up for grabs!</p>
<p>This is the first of a series of Experimental Marathon Matches that TopCoder is running in coordination with Harvard Business School. The structure and rules for these events are a departure from anything that TopCoder has run in the past, in that we will be exploring how change effects the way individuals collaborate and share information about approaches and code.</p>
<p>The competitions will all involve solving a computational biology problem. This first problem is related to genomics. We believe that the TopCoder community may have an interesting take on these problems and could potentially come up with breakthroughs that benefit science beyond TopCoder.</p>

<p>The choice was tough, as many apps pushed the envelope of integrating Ribbit’s voice, telephony and messaging API. Overall, we looked for apps that achieved innovative interactions with Flash — and integrated Ribbit’s features to make significant impact on the way we communicate.</p>
<p>Congratulations to <strong>rominirani, senagbe, joedeveloper, </strong>and<strong> dhbellol</strong> &#8211; who each won a $15,000 Grand Prize. And to <strong>villmer</strong>, whose <a href="http://killerappchallenge.ribbit.com/news/?page_id=576">Lucid Viewer</a> app won both its category and the Killer App Challenge &#8220;Best in Show&#8221; award, for a total of $30,000!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=tournaments&amp;d2=tco09&amp;d3=overview&amp;d4=overview">2009 TopCoder Open</a> is as exciting as ever! Slowly but surely the large group of competitors that started off in this competition have been getting narrowed down to the top finalists that will soon be making their way to Las Vegas! Keep up-to-date with the action of all the competitions!</p>
<p><span id="more-704"></span><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tco09?module=AlgorithmAdvancers">Algorithm</a>:<br />
TCO09 Algorithm Round 4 will take place on Saturday, March 28 at Noon EDT (GMT/UTC -4).  <a href="http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=3&amp;day=28&amp;year=2009&amp;hour=12&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=98">See what time it starts in your area</a>.  This round will feature 120 coders all hoping to make it to round 5 and one more chance at that trip to Las Vegas!  Don&#8217;t miss the excitement of this round!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tco09?module=MarathonAdvancers">Marathon</a>:<br />
The final round of the Marathon Competition is now underway.  This two week long competition will give us our top ten finalists!  Want to see what they have to solve to make it to Las Vegas?  You can register for <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=ViewActiveContests">Marathon Match 52</a> and compete along side them!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tco09?module=ModDashLeaders">Mod Dash</a>:<br />
The Mod Dash is an all new competition onsite.  The leaderboard is looking tense and the top eight point getters are winning a trip to Las Vegas!  The onsite Mod Dash championship will consist of three rounds. Each round will consist of 6 consecutive Mod Dashes. Competitors will have 10 minutes to solve the presented bug or enhancement. The first competitor to correctly solve the problem will win the Mod Dash and 100 points. But there’s a catch – each competitor who successfully solves the Mod Dash AFTER the winning submission will reduce the winner’s score by 10 points.</p>
<p>At the end of three rounds, the competitor with the most points will be the 2009 Mod Dash Champion!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tco09?module=StudioLeaders&amp;eid=3009">Studio</a>:<br />
There are many TCO-Eligible <a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewActiveContests">Studio Competitions</a> going on right now. If you have not been to Studio lately, hop over there and check out the awesome designs that the members are submitting.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/i_on_computer.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-654" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/i_on_computer.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What brought you to TopCoder?</strong><br />
I was looking for some practice to ACM ICPC, some friends showed me TopCoder, and told me that it was a way of learning.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month?</strong><br />
I was surprised by your choice and felt rewarded by my dedication on the study of algorithms.<br />
Like we usually say here in Ceará/Brasil, &#8220;This is so much money&#8221;, meaning this is something that I really appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
Solving algorithm problems on online judges! Just kidding. In fact, I like to play the saxophone, go to church, and go out with my girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
In TopCoder we try to improve our knowledge on algorithms, increase our rating and earn respect among other coders, so we learn that to achieve that we need dedication, effort and patience. This principle applies for everything we do in life.</p>

<p><em>saarixx on vacation in Port Aventura, the amusement park in Spain.</em></p>
<p><strong>What brought you to TopCoder?</strong><br />
<strong>ragetrue</strong> recommended me to visit TopCoder&#8217;s web site about three years ago. This happened during the Ukrainian national programming competition. I visited it in 2 months after this event. First, I tried Algorithm competitions. They were found to be unsuccessful for me. But then I participated in the Intel Multi-threading Marathon competition, placed second and won a good prize. This event heavily raised my interest in TopCoder in general.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month?</strong><br />
It’s great (especially taking into account that my performance in February gave me a good chance to become a TCO design champion)!!!</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
I like watching Formula-1 racings and my favourite TV shows (“The Big Bang Theory”, “My Name is Earl” and “Two and a Half Men”), playing tennis (both table and court) and soccer with my friends.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
At TopCoder I understood that I should not be afraid of new technologies. When I started with TopCoder, I hadn&#8217;t known C# and Java. But during design competitions I learned them and realized that one week can be enough to learn some specific technology like WCF, WPF or JPA good enough.</p>
<p>Development: <strong>assistant</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/untitled.bmp"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-658" src="http://www.topcoder.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/untitled.bmp" alt="" width="274" height="280" /></a></p>
<p><em>assistant enjoying lobster in Sydney</em></p>
<p><strong>What brought you to TopCoder?</strong><br />
<strong>haha</strong> posted an introduction to TopCoder on a BBS. It mentioned the outsourcing model of TopCoder and I felt it interesting. After a few tries, I began to enjoy the competitions.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month?</strong><br />
This is a big surprise.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
Reading, enjoying movies and traveling.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?<br />
</strong>Don&#8217;t be afraid to lose. If you don&#8217;t try, you already and always lose.</p>
<p>Studio: <strong>djnapier</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_0410_1_web.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-659" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_0410_1_web.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="228" /></a></p>
<p><em>Here is djnapier outside the stadium that hosted the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.</em></p>
<p><strong>What brought you to Studio?</strong><br />
I went to a summer program for Mathematics in early 2005 and although I&#8217;ve never done any maths at that level since, another attendee (a coder on here) suggested I should enter the TopCoder Open logo competition (I think I came 4th that year?). Fast forward a few years, with an education qualification and few years working experience under my belt, my skills are a bit more refined which has brought about more success at TopCoder.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Designer of the Month?</strong><br />
Very rewarding – many times it has been frustrating to come third or not even get placed but in those instances it&#8217;s because the client just has a different idea of what they want vs. your vision for the project. So to be acknowledged as Designer of the Month is a personal reward for persisting with it.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides Studio?</strong><br />
I really enjoy music and photography and wish I had time to refine my skills in those areas too (alas there are only 24 hours in a day!). I would love to be a DJ someday as I have great respect for those who can get a dancefloor rocking. Sometimes I need to get away from the computer and do nothing design-related which is a great unwind.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at Studio that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
Organisation and time-management! Wow, what a kick in the butt it has been. Trying to get a submission that will pass screening in on time can take its toll – especially living in a different time-zone. Waking up at 3.30AM to find a submission fail has been tough but ultimately rewarding (not only because I was able to fix and resubmit – but slowly learning to double check everything and submit only once!).</p>

SNIA XAM has put together a brief survey and will be giving away 20 prizes to randomly selected members who fill out the survey. See the survey <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ViewSurvey&amp;sid=28655">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SNIA XAM Initiative:</strong><br />
The Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) is a not-for-profit global organization, made up of some 400 member companies and 7,000 individuals spanning virtually the entire storage industry. SNIA&#8217;s mission is to lead the storage industry worldwide in developing and promoting standards, technologies, and educational services to empower organizations in the management of information. The SNIA XAM (eXtensible Access Method) Initiative has recently released an industry standard, XAM API, and a software developer kit to implement this standard.</p>
<p>The SNIA XAM Initiative is proud to welcome the world&#8217;s top programming talent to tap into your ideas and test your programming skills to accelerate the creation of tools and solutions based on XAM. Living in an era of rampant information explosion and the need to manage, secure, and access vast amounts of data is exceeding the capabilities of traditional data technologies based on file systems and databases.</p>
<p><span id="more-3477"></span></p>
<p><strong>XAM Standard Solves Vendor Lock-in and Traditional Technology Limitations</strong><br />
The XAM standard puts power back in the hands of IT by providing a common interface for applications to seamlessly interoperate across XAM-enabled fixed-content or SAN storage devices. The XAM standard empowers IT and service providers to deploy a variety of storage media from multiple vendors and even migrate content from one storage platform to another.</p>
<p>XAM solves key problems for specialized storage and write once, read many devices providing long-term data retention by storing information in non-modifiable format on disk. Unfortunately, these systems require integration with applications that write to them. This forces datacenters and service providers to be locked-in to one vendor&#8217;s fixed-content platform, or incur the cost of integrating applications across multiple fixed-media platform interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>XAM Features:</strong><br />
*XAM stores content as &#8220;objects&#8221; that consist of data and annotated metadata. An example is an X-ray image that is stored as the data component, while the patient&#8217;s name and other medical record details are stored as attached metadata. Metadata could be stored in a uniform format that can be indexed and searchable by independent tools. Also, metadata can help record and save important contextual information about the data, which may be used to interpret and make use of the data many years later;</p>
<p>*Metadata and data fields inside a XAM object can be defined as modifiable or non-modifiable. Changes to a field marked non-modifiable will result in a new version of the XAM object being created in the underlying storage device. This allows XAM objects to meet authenticity and chain of custody tracking requirements for e-discovery and medial environments.</p>
<p>*XAM generates a globally unique name (address) for each object, which is independent of the current computing environment, organization, location, or technology. As a consequence, objects may move around freely in time, changing their physical or technological location, all transparent to their current owner. This property is a fundamental enabler for transparent information lifecycle management (ILM).</p>
<p>The Topcoder SNIA XAM coding challenge offers developers the opportunity to:<br />
*Create innovative ideas and applications for XAM<br />
*Create innovative tools to speed the implementation of XAM<br />
*Inspire developers to participate in industry standards development<br />
*Create XAM vendor modules for new platforms, low cost platforms and cloud computing<br />
*Integrate XAM libraries and XAM VIMs into operating systems and other relevant data computing stacks</p>
<p>Some idea categories for applications are the USA&#8217;s approach to Electronic Health Records, the ability to move user created data across various social media sites, enabling federated searches across Web-based digital libraries, metadata organization to improve the quality of results in an e-Discovery case, and improve how national governments and libraries will preserve data for future generations.</p>
<p>The SNIA XAM Initiative has created a community of resources to rapidly immerse yourself in understanding XAM, getting questions answered, and working with the XAM software:<br />
*<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/xam-developers-group">SNIA XAM Developers Group</a><br />
<a href="http://www.snia.org/forums/xam/">*SNIA XAM Initiative</a><br />
<a href="http://www.snia.org/forums/xam/technology/specs">*SNIA XAM 1.0 Final Technical Position Specifications</a><br />
<a href="http://www.snia.org/forums/xam/technology/software">*SNIA XAM SDK Working Draft Release</a></p>
<p>SNIA XAM wishes all the TCO09 competitors best of luck!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever thought:  Why is it so difficult to find people that can help me in the digital world?   I know I have to use digital media (web, mobile IM, email, etc.) to find, present to and connect with my customers and business partners to make my business more effective, I just don’t know how best to do it and don’t seem able to find the best people to help me.  I know there are tons of tools, gadgets, etc. to help me out, but none of them do the thing I need most: none of them listen to me and help me get what I need done.  With the internet and communication being what they are today, shouldn’t there be an easier way to connect with people that can help me hone my message, connect with *my* customers and get the work I need done to engage my customers in the digital world?</p>
<p>If you have, then all we can say is: Boy, have you come to the right place!</p>
<p>As the world becomes more and more digitally based (web, mobile, email, IM and who knows what’s next), finding, communicating and interacting with your customers and business partners requires whole new sets of skills.   The task can be daunting.  Finding the right people with the right skills is tantamount to finding a needle in a haystack.  Pick wrong and you won’t just make your wallet quite a bit thinner, you’ll waste precious time that could have been used getting it right.  TopCoder has turned this paradigm upside-down.  No longer are you going to have to go find the people who can best get your work done, they’ll find you.</p>
<p>Since 2001, TopCoder has been building one of the largest and most active communities of software developers and creative designers anywhere.  So far, we’ve admittedly been a little selfish in sharing these folks with the rest of the world.  Once you get in here you’ll see why you can’t really blame us: This is one of the most talented, interesting and helpful groups of people you’re likely to find (for instance, this website and everything on it has been designed and built by them).  But, as they say, ‘you can’t keep a good person (or, in our case, about 170,000 – and growing &#8211; of them) down’.  TopCoder Direct is your way to get involved.</p>
<p><span id="more-903"></span></p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>We start with a really big community and add a dose of competition.  Turns out, passionate people love to compete.  What are they competing for?  A whole host of things (money, skill development, recognition, fun), but, with a little help in defining a competition, some of them would love to compete for you.  Through a series of competitions, you’ll build logos, web sites, mobile apps and pretty much anything digital you can imagine.</p>
<p>It all starts in what we call TopCoder Direct.  Direct – as its name implies – takes out the middle and puts you in immediate touch with the community.  Whether you’re trying to build or change your website, building a web based ordering system for your customers, need to do a presentation for a customer or a new flyer or marketing piece, Direct is your center of operations.  It will allow you to get help, post competitions, see results of competitions and interact with the community.</p>
<p>What do you use it for?  Ultimately, anything: Logo design, web site and page layout and design, icons, powerpoint presentations, flyers, product catalogs, customer service and database systems and  mobile applications to name a few.  Want a banner or series of banners for a new product or general marketing campaign?  Direct.  Want a new website because the old one is tired (embarrassing?)? Direct.  Want to let customers order directly through your web site or via their phone?  Direct.</p>
<p>Now there is a lot more to TopCoder and Studio than just Direct.  There are forums, blogs, big tournaments and events and a host of other ways to get involved.  We hope that you’ll get involved in as much as you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>We need you.</strong></p>
<p>One of the tenets of TopCoder is that without our community, we are nothing.  By asking you to join, we don’t just want your business, we want your input.  Do we have it all figured out?  Not by a long shot.  Letting the community know what of your experience is positive and what is negative is the only way we have to make everyone’s experience better.  Don’t be afraid to post in the forums: <a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/forums">http://studio.topcoder.com/forums</a> or shoot an email.  If you don’t like something or think it can be done better, let us know.  We have a long way to go and need your help in getting there.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that TopCoder Direct is in beta.  We can’t guarantee that stuff won’t break, that we won’t lose your stuff.  What we can guarantee is that there need to be many new features and Direct will go through many changes.</p>
<p>I’m not prone to ‘speak’ for the community.  Like any community, there are many diverse interests and opinions and we respect them all.  In this case, though, I’m confident that I can speak for the community in saying:  Welcome!  We’re glad you’re here.  We can’t wait to get started!</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000"><span id="more-580"></span>JPEG 2000</a> is an image format meant to be an improvement over the original JPEG format. Linden Lab, the creator of Second Life, uses this file format heavily via the <a href="http://www.openjpeg.org/">OpenJPEG</a> library, an open source project. While these images have very good image quality for their file sizes and can be decoded as they stream across a network channel, a drawback has been that they are computationally expensive to decode. Because almost all of the textures in Second Life are encoded via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000">JPEG 2000</a>, the decode performance is very important to millions of Second Life users. Your task in this problem is to build on the <a href="http://www.openjpeg.org/">OpenJPEG</a> library, improving its decode speed. Participants may submit code written in C++.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TopCoder has a customer that needs your help. They are looking for an algorithm to better predict which of their clients will successfully convert loan requests into funded loans.  They have provided historical data consisting of millions of records, spanning three years, and representing billions of dollars in loans. One of the key challenges to this problem is that it may take up to five months for the company to hear whether a loan is funded or not. Thus, this problem will require you to develop novel machine learning techniques accounting for the fact that the training data contains loans which, while not funded yet, will eventually be funded.</p>
<p>Whoever is able to best predict which loans will be funded will walk away with the $2,500 prize!  You have until Monday, March 2, 2009 at Noon EST (GMT/UTC -5) to fine tune your solution.</p>
<p>Check out the FundingPrediction problem statement <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=ViewProblemStatement&amp;compid=9145&amp;rd=13754">here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the January Coders and Designers of the Month! TopCoder caught up with them to find out how it felt to receive this honor and learn a bit more about them.</p>
<p><span id="more-511"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Algorithm: Yasuh</strong></h2>
<p><strong> What brought you to TopCoder?<br />
</strong>In 2007, I found an article that introduced a person who joined TopCoder. I was very interested in ICPC, and wanted to solve problems online, so I decided to join TopCoder.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month?</strong><br />
Unbelievable! I&#8217;m very surprised to hear that, and very happy now.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
I like scuba diving, so I go to Okinawa twice a year. It is very fun to dive into the sea and play with fish.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
Think again before doing something. SRMs are more difficult than ICPC because coding phase and system phases are completely separated. So I have to think and think again about the algorithm and my source code.</p>
<h2><strong>Design: Urmass<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/urmassin-the-university-with-professor1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-515" style="white 1px solid" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/urmassin-the-university-with-professor1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></strong></h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/urmass-at-home.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-513" style="white 1px solid" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/urmass-at-home.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong></p>
<p><em>Photos are of Urmass at his computer and with his professor.</em></p>
<p><strong>What brought you to TopCoder? </strong><br />
A couple of years ago I participated in the ACM Collegiate Programming Contests where such prominent TC members as real_vg and dmytro also participated. They introduced me to TopCoder.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month? </strong><br />
I feel myself very excited. This prize inspires me to improve my skills.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder? </strong><br />
I like music. I have a lot of records and I also play guitar.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life? </strong><br />
Competitions really help to tighten up my discipline.</p>
<h2><strong>Development: utlovey<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/utlovey-wuxi1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-518" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/utlovey-wuxi1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="286" /></a></strong></h2>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-516" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/utlovey-tongji-university.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/utlovey-wuxi.jpg"></a></p>
<p><em>Photos are of TongJi University and on vacation with his girlfriend.</em></p>
<p><strong>What brought you to TopCoder?</strong><br />
My classmate introduced the TopCoder to me and I think joining it is the best way to improve my skills.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month?</strong><br />
Very surprised and excited. I feel lucky to be chosen as the coder of this month.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
I like playing soccer and watching soccer match since my childhood. It brings me perseverance and a lot of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
Value your time and work efficiently. I think it is the most important thing what I learned in TopCoder.</p>
<h2><strong>Studio: srinivasc</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What brought you to Studio?</strong><br />
One of my colleagues referred this website for a competition and I was impressed with TopCoder competitions.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Designer of the Month?</strong><br />
I was excited and I want to participate more aggressively in TopCoder competitions</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides Studio?</strong><br />
Playing Chess</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at Studio that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
That which does not kill you makes you stronger … LOL</p>

See the <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/news/2009/02/12/bug-bash-weekend-more-bugs-more-money-more-prizes/">post above</a> for more information.</p>
<p><span id="more-412"></span></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wiki/display/tc/Active+Bug+Races">bug races</a> just got a lot more interesting!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/bottlemug.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-414" style="margin: 5px 7px" src="http://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/bottlemug.jpg" alt="" width="134" height="180" /></a>Not only is every bug race now eligible for <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tco09">TCO</a> points in the new <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=tournaments&amp;d2=tco09&amp;d3=moddash&amp;d4=description">&#8220;Mod Dash&#8221;</a> competition track, but there&#8217;s a bunch of these things we want fixed really badly, so we&#8217;re throwing something extra into the pot!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve identified a group of bugs as part of the 24 Hour Bug Bash, mostly related to the Flex Cockpit.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to give the top five earners on these over the next day a TopCoder T-Shirt (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsOdjYLA7VM&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=68A">like this one</a>) and your choice of either the fabulous water bottle or the fabulous coffee mug seen here!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re starting the Bash right now, and it ends at 3:00pm Eastern Standard Time tomorrow, Thursday, February 12. (Yes, that&#8217;s 25.5 hours &#8211; but who&#8217;s counting?)</p>
<p>All fixes submitted before the deadline that pass review will be eligible, and the top five prize winners on Bug Bash Bugs will win. Just look for the bugs with<strong> &#8220;Bug Bash&#8221; </strong>in the title and&#8230; <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wiki/display/tc/Active+Bug+Races">get bashing!</a></p>

<p>A TopCoder member&#8217;s point of view, writing to members, of the Conceptualization and Specification contests. It includes tips and secrets for what to do and how to compete well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">&#8220;The TopCoder software development methodology is mostly based on the usage of open community members. Many low level steps of software building have been opened to the development community. Anybody can participate in designing and coding software components, making the software GUI, assembling and testing final applications. But now, a new exciting possibility is available – making application Concepts and Specifications of business requirements. It means, the community members are able to work with TopCoder customers from the very beginning of the project. The output is a high level picture of the project – so your ideas and concepts will be the initial requirements for architects, designers, coders, assemblers and testers!&#8221;</p>

<p>While there are lots of <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=tutorials&amp;d2=alg_index">resources</a> here on TopCoder, we wanted to highlight this blog post from TC member <strong>vijay03</strong>, who <a href="http://thevc.wordpress.com/2008/02/27/getting-started-on-topcoder/">wrote last February</a> in his own blog about getting started in Algorithm competitions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">&#8220;Programming contests are a way of identifying people good programming ( and general computer science ) talent. Companies pay good money to easily identify top talent for their company. Plus Topcoder acts as a sort of mediator between companies who want some custom software built quickly and developers who are willing to take on projects.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2009 TopCoder High School touranment finalized on January 24, 2009 and <strong>crazyb0y</strong> from China came out on top earning him $3,000 in prize money! Congratulations to <strong>crazyb0y</strong> and all the high school members that participated in the competition.</p>
<p>TopCoder caught up with the new TCHS09 champion for a brief interview.</p>
<p><span id="more-256"></span><strong>How does it feel to be the 2009 TopCoder High School Champion?</strong><br />
I feel REALLY lucky. The other coders did a great job as well. I made some mistakes on the HARD, but luckily it failed on sample. Finally was the room assignment (I started challenging after five minutes).</p>
<p><strong>What brought you to TopCoder?</strong><br />
I can&#8217;t remember why I participated in my first SRM, but after it, I decided to continue. Maybe it was the unique competition environment which brought me to TopCoder.</p>
<p><strong>What are your favorite hobbies besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
I have a lot, like ping-pong, movies, bicycling, &#8230;<br />
But I don&#8217;t play computer games.</p>
<p><strong>What do you wish to study after high school?</strong><br />
Shanghai Jiao Tong University</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
You can challenge everyone (even a target) regardless of your current position.</p>

<p>The 2009 TopCoder Open is here!</p>
<p>Well, not officially, but we were just too excited to wait.  We have launched a few competitions this weekend that are TCO–point eligible.  That means if you compete in these contests, you are already beginning your quest for those trips to Las Vegas, Nevada in June!</p>
<p>When we officially launch the TCO09 next week, you will still need to register for the event in order for these competition points to count, but don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll remind everyone who competes in any of these early TCO events when it&#8217;s time to register.</p>
<p><span id="more-241"></span></p>
<p>Among the eligible competitions are the AOL Galleries Front End assemblies that build a Struts based front end over the existing Galleries service.  The actions are already coded.  Competitors will be creating JSP code and integrate the front end with AOL&#8217;s OpenAuth API.</p>
<p>Plus &#8211; we&#8217;ve launched three conceptualization contests as part of the Sensations Developer Challenge Saturday. Not only are there TCO points for these contests, but the winners of these contests will also be eligible for a share of the $25,000 Sensations Bonus Prize, which will also be awarded at the TCO.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the three Conceptualization contests:</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sensations.aol.com/panel/#wlodkowski">Thomas Wlodkowski</a> is the Director of Accessibility at AOL, and an Advisory Board member for the <a href="http://sensations.aol.com/">Sensations Developer Challenge</a>. He blogs today about the assistive technologies he himself uses in his daily life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">While surfing through the Sensations site, you will see references to technologies that you may not have ever seen or used personally. But without assistive technologies like screen reader software, alternative keyboard devices, voice recognition software and other products, people with disabilities couldn&#8217;t access computers and the Internet.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">So, with this in mind, I thought a series of posts to put some context around how people with disabilities access and use mainstream technologies might be helpful. Since I happen to be blind, I&#8217;ll focus on my view of the world when accessed via a computer.</p>

<p><em></em>Round 2 of 2009 TCHS Tournament had 334 participants, and 250 of them were to advance to the next round, so a good time on easy guaranteed advancement. The problem set was relatively easy but quite challengeable, and the challenge phase was pretty eventful this time.</p>
<p>The match was won by tourist, due to impressive time on all problems and 3 successfull challenges. exod40 with 5 challenges took the second place, and neal_wu came third.</p>

<em>TopCoder Member</em></p>
<p>Happy new year ! The first SRM in 2009 attracted 1143 coders.  Div 2 easy was     easy as always. Div 1 easy / Div 2 medium was not so standard and confused lots     of coders. Div 1 Medium was tricky &#8211; like many other mediums. Hard problems in both     division were solvable and about 20 coders in each division proved it.</p>
<p>Div 1 was won by <a class="coderTextRed" href="../../tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10574855&amp;tab=alg">Petr</a>, who had the fastest solution for hard and earned 25 points in challenges. He was closely followed by <a class="coderTextRed" href="../../tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=15600311&amp;tab=alg">WSX</a> and <a class="coderTextRed" href="../../tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=21113940&amp;tab=alg">Ostap</a>. Both of them made succesfull challenges and needed one more to win this match     and their rooms were full of wrong mediums, but they didn&#8217;t use their chance. Great     result anyway.</p>
<p>Div 2 was won by <a class="coderTextBlue" href="../../tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22682913&amp;tab=alg">Alex_KPR</a>, who had good times on all 3 problems. He was followed by <a class="coderTextBlue" href="../../tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22686265&amp;tab=alg">hellodj</a> and newcomer <a class="coderTextYellow" href="../../tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22766988&amp;tab=alg">adrianoo07</a>.</p>

<p><em></em>Round 1 of 2009 TCHS Tournament attracted 399 competitors, which is more than twice the number of participants in 2008 TCHS Tournament. With at most 500 advancers to Round 2 it was enough to get a positive score to advance, and nearly 90% of the participants managed to accomplish this. The round was much easier than a regular HS match, and some competitors were done with all 3 problems in as little as 20 minutes.</p>
<p>decowboy took the lead after the coding phase due to the fastest total time on the problems, with tourist and Zuza closely following. The challenge phase brought neal_wu +25 points and the win. decowboy and tourist took second and third places, respectively.</p>

<em>TopCoder Member</em></p>
<p>The last SRM in this year gathered together not so many participants &#8211; 1088, 488 in Div-I and 600 in Div-II. In Div-I almost everybody solved the easy problem (partially because of good example cases).</p>
<p>However, the other two problems were quite tough. This resulted in small number of solutions and only 4 coders solved all three problems. qizichao was much faster than anybody else (1st on the Hard and 3rd on the Medium overall) and got his first SRM victory with more than 300 points gap. zhuojie and Petr took second and third places, respectively, with very close scores. Both of them would have scored more, but resubmitted their Hards.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You now have the power to directly access our Global Community of software developers and graphic artists, who are ready to compete to design your web project.</p>
<p>In this beta release, you can use TopCoder Direct to launch competitions on TopCoder Studio for logos, web page designs, print work, and much more. You simply describe what you need designed, offer a prize amount you’re willing to pay then launch a contest, and our community will submit their designs to compete for your prize. At the conclusion of your contest, the winning design you choose is available for download immediately.</p>
<p>A set of easy to use widgets give you the ability to create a project, launch competitions, monitor their progress, view your submissions, then choose a winner and download your new design immediately. As TopCoder Direct grows, you’ll be able to launch larger projects to have full web sites and applications built, software components and eventually everything that the TopCoder Community does now for our enterprise customers, all without the need for assistance from TopCoder staff.</p>
<p>Becoming a TopCoder Direct member is free, you’re only charged when you launch a competition, and when you download your winning design(s). You decide the prize money your design is worth, and it’s easy enough to browse other competitions on Studio to get a better idea of the prize purse you should offer to ensure the highest number of quality designs. You only pay the prize if you’re satisfied with the submissions at the end of the competition. <a href="http://software.topcoder.com/">More on how to use TopCoder Direct</a></p>
<p><strong>The Studio Cup</strong></p>
<p>Depending on what type of competition you decide to run through Direct, there is an administration fee that is charged when you launch.</p>
<p>This fee covers not only the admin costs for TopCoder to host the contest, but it also funds the “Studio Cup”, a monthly prize pool for our competitors which grows in value as each new contest is launched. Competitors earn points for placing in the top five of any contest on TopCoder, and at the end of each month the point leaders take home a share of the guaranteed prize pool. So every contest you launch carries a number of Studio Cup points as an added incentive to compete &#8211; in addition to the first prize money you’re offering.</p>
<p>As a member of the TopCoder Community, you take an active role in the process of scoring and rating our competitors for the Studio Cup. Since there is no better judge of the quality of designs for a customer than the customer himself, we ask you to help us score the submissions by indicating your Top Five designs at the end of your contest. You are only responsible for purchasing your first prize winner (and any other submissions you choose to purchase), but your selection of a Top Five is the biggest factor in how our competitors will finish in the Studio Cup rankings, and the best incentive for them to compete often and submit top quality design work.</p>
<p>TopCoder Direct is in beta, so we’re working out some kinks here and there. Be sure to visit <a href="http://software.topcoder.com/">here</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Good luck and have fun!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The TopCoder Direct version 1.0 Release is the tool you’ll use to access our community. Once you’ve registered for a free TopCoder account, Direct version 1.0 will allow you to launch competitions on TopCoder Studio for logos, web page designs, print work, etc. A set of default widgets give you the ability to create a project, launch competitions, monitor their progress, view your submissions, then choose a winner and download your new design immediately. As we add new widgets and functionality, you’ll be able to launch larger projects to have full web sites and applications built, software components and eventually everything that the TopCoder Community does now for our enterprise customers, all without the need for assistance from TopCoder staff.</p>
<p>For more information about how to use the Direct, visit <a href="http://software.topcoder.com/">here.</a></p>
<p>This is a beta release, so there may be some bugs here and there, but we’re working around the clock to perfect the process and adding new functionality every day. If you want to alert us to a bug, or if you need special assistance, send us an email at <a title="mailto:directAssist@topcoder.com" href="mailto:directAssist@topcoder.com">directAssist@topcoder.com</a>.</p>
