<b>Projects:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Personalization:</b><br>
Personalization is about people, getting to know them and customizing their experiences to their likes, passive personalization is the process of learning about people from what they do, not what they say they do. Artificial Intelligence and its application in this space is an Edge Technology and not everything is known. For AOL, there are several advantages to Personalization, we will enable or empower our users to reach the "Long Tail" in what they are searching for, Create a sticky experience that gets people to what they want with minimum fuss, from the Advertising perspective there will be a model that will benefit from this information and offer users what they are interested in, making adverts relevant and less of a nuisance.</li>
<li><b>MSRP (Modular Search Results Platform):</b><br>
The MSRP platform is an open framework, web content delivery system. MSRP pages are made up of defined modules that will render content from various sources depending on the defined source for that content. MSRP controls data traffic from the user through the routing system and back, using any display generation format supported by the framework. MSRP uses a Response Analysis Engine (RAE )module to decide dynamically, how to arrange data from the data source infrastructure for any given user, thus brings the capability to customize each web page view by a user, dynamically.</li>
<li><b>Search 7.0:</b><br>
The latest version of AOL's search application, 7.0 is currently under development, this product will change dramatically the way search results are delivered, it is optimized for high-speed users who will get great Web search from Google, plus relevant multimedia results &mdash; pictures, videos, sound clips, local information and more all on one page. With the new AOL search the idea is that users will be able to search less and discover more.</li>
