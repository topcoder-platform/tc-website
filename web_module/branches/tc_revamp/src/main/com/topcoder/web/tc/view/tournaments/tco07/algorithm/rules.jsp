<h2>Overview of the Tournament</h2>
<p>The 2007 TopCoder Open ("TCO") Algorithm Competition will take place between February 19 and June 29, 2007. It will consist of three (3) online qualification rounds, four (4) online elimination rounds and three (3) onsite final rounds: the Semifinal, Wildcard and Championship rounds. The prize purse for this competition is $100,000 in cash. Up to 450 competitors will win a cash prize and, for competing in Online Round #1, up to 1,800 competitors will receive a participatory prize. The top 48 finishers in the online rounds will advance to the onsite Semifinal and Championship rounds, held at The Mirage in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA on June 27, 28 and 29, 2007.</p>

<a name="eligibility"></a>

<ul>
<li>Must be at least 18 years of age (as of March 29, 2007); AND</li>
<li>Must currently be eligible for participation in TopCoder projects (i.e. not suspended from TopCoder).</li>
</ul>
<p>
TopCoder members who are 18 years of age or older as of March 29, 2007 are eligible to win cash prizes, unless otherwise prohibited. The TopCoder Open is void in the Quebec province of Canada and elsewhere where prohibited by applicable law. Cash prizes will not be paid to residents of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria.
</p>
<p>
Employees of TopCoder, Inc. and of all official tournament sponsors, regardless of commitment date as sponsor, including any companies involved in the production (including prize suppliers), implementation and distribution of this tournament and their advertising or promotion agencies, parent companies, service providers, agents, officers, subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other persons or entities directly associated with the tournament and members of their immediate families (parent, child, sibling, and spouse of each) and/or persons living in the same household as such persons, are ineligible to enter the tournament. If a competitor's employer signs on as an official sponsor of the tournament after February 19, 2007, then that competitor will be removed from further participation in the tournament. TopCoder members who are performing internships for any official tournament sponsor between February 19 and June 29, 2007 are also ineligible to compete.
</p>
<p>
Those members who are eligible to compete in any of the four tournament competitions will be permitted to participate in any/all of them online.  However, in the event a member becomes a finalist in more than one competition and the onsite competition times overlap, the member must choose only one competition in which to participate as a finalist by May 11, 2007.
</p>
<p>
In the event that a competitor is disqualified from any round, no other competitors will be added in his/her place. The only exception to this is advancement to the onsite rounds.

</p>
<p>
<b>Qualification Spots</b> - All members who do not receive an automatic berth and who meet all of the tournament eligibility criteria can compete for one of the remaining 1,650 qualification spots in the tournament. Three (3) Qualification Rounds will be held and the top 550 scorers from each Qualification Round will win a spot in Online Round #1. Please note that the top 150 rated members who receive an automatic berth will not be allowed to compete in any of the Qualification Rounds. Also, those members who qualify for the tournament during one qualification attempt will not be allowed to compete in future Qualification Rounds. 
</p>
<p>
The schedule and details of the Qualification Rounds are as follows:

<p>
The format for each Qualification Round will be the same as all other tournament rounds, which is outlined in the Competition Round Structure section. 
</p>
<p>
Members will be rated at the conclusion of their qualification attempt based on their performance against others competing in the same round. All qualifiers will be assigned tournament seeds based on their Algorithm rating following the Qualification Rounds. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the Qualification Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner: 
<ul>
<li>By rating (higher is better) prior to the Qualification Round.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to Online Round #1.</li>
</ul>

<a name="structure"></a>
<h2>Online Elimination Rounds</h2>
<p>
Participants in each online round must register for the round in the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than five (5) minutes prior to the start of the round. All start times will be communicated as Eastern Daylight Time (UTC/GMT -4), so contestants in different time zones must adjust accordingly. If a coder does not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition. 
</p>
<p>
All competitors who have qualified for an online round will indicate the section of the round in which they wish to compete. During tournament registration competitors will indicate their preferences regarding Online Round #1. TopCoder will fill the sections for Online Round #1 based on indicated preference and on member rating (i.e., higher rated members are given preference over lower rated members). 
</p>
<p>
All competitors in a specific section will be assigned to rooms based on 'dartboard seeding' (completely random). Rooms will be created such that each room has a maximum of 25 competitors. The number of rooms in each round is (maximum # advancers in the round)/25. 
</p>
<p>
The dates and times of the online rounds of competition are as follows:

<h2>Scoring and Advancing during Online Rounds</h2>
<p>
After each section of competition in the Online Rounds, the highest scorers from all rooms in the section will advance to the next online round. Coder advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round for each coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater than zero) point total. The structure of the online rounds is as follows: 
<ul>
<li><b>Online Round #1</b><br>
Up to 720 coders will compete in each section and up to 300 will advance from each section. The highest 300 scorers across all rooms in each section will advance to Online Round #2.</li>
<li><b>Online Round #2</b><br>
Up to 900 coders will compete and up to 300 will advance. The highest 300 scorers across all rooms will advance to Online Round #3.</li>
<li><b>Online Round #3</b><br>
Up to 300 coders will compete and up to 150 will advance. The highest 150 scorers across all rooms will advance to Online Round #4.</li>
<li><b>Online Round #4</b><br>
Up to 150 coders will compete and up to 48 will advance. The highest 48 scorers across all rooms will advance to the field of Semifinalists.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the online rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner: 
<ul>
<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during the rounds of the tournament in which all of the tied participants were presented with the same set of problems (excluding the Qualification Round).</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then by tournament seed.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Competition Round Structure</h2>
<p>
Each online and onsite round of competition (including the Qualification Rounds) consists of three phases: Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. (Note: The format of these competition rounds is similar to the format of TopCoder Single Round Matches. The rules in place for Single Round Matches as of March 29, 2007 will also apply to the online and onsite rounds of the TCO, with the exception of the Unused Code Rule during the onsite rounds.) 
<ul>
<li><b>The Coding Phase</b> is a timed event in which all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened until the time it was submitted. During the online rounds, the Coding Phase will last 75 minutes. During the onsite rounds, the Coding Phase will last 85 minutes.</li>
<li><b>The Challenge Phase</b> is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem's submission points by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger. Unsuccessful challenges will incur a point reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against the challenger's total score in that round of competition. During the online rounds, the Challenge Phase will last 15 minutes. During the onsite round, the Challenge Phase will last 10 minutes.</li>
<li><b>The System Testing Phase</b> is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem.

<h2>Onsite Semifinal and Championship Rounds</h2>
<h3>Important Information</h3>
<p>
<b>Travel Confirmation</b><br>
The forty-eight (48) advancers from Online Round #4 will travel to Las Vegas on Tuesday, June 26, 2007 to compete in the Semifinal rounds of the tournament, held on Wednesday, June 27 and Thursday, June 28, 2007. All contestants must arrive at The Mirage no later than 4:00 PM PDT on Tuesday, June 26, 2007. 
</p>
<p>
All contestants must confirm their attendance at the onsite rounds no later than 5:00 PM EDT (UTC/GMT -4) on Friday, May 11, 2007. That is, contestants must have acquired any necessary travel visas and know for certain that they can travel to the U.S. by that date and time.  In order for a finalist to confirm attendance for the onsite finals, it is necessary for any finalist traveling from outside the United States to show proof of visa and/or passport by the deadline of 5:00 PM EDT (UTC/GMT -4) on Friday, May 11, 2007. Finalists may do this by emailing a copy of their documents to Jessie D'Amato Ford at <a href="mailto:jford@topcoder.com">jford@topcoder.com</a>. Competitors who fail to meet this requirement by the deadline will not be able to attend the onsite finals and will be replaced as an onsite finalist. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Visa Assistance</b><br>
At the end of each Online Round #1, TopCoder will issue visa invitation letters at the request of international competitors who require one to obtain a travel visa to enter the United States. All competitors that advance to Online Round 1 will receive a request form to fill out if they require a letter.  Competitors will have until 5:00 PM EDT (GMT/UTC -4) on Monday, April 23, 2007 to request a letter. Visas can take a significant amount of time to obtain in certain countries; therefore, for those competitors who need a letter, it is in their best interest to request one well before the deadline. The cost of obtaining a visa is the sole responsibility of the competitor. If you fail to request a visa invitation letter by the above date, TopCoder will not assist you in the process of obtaining a travel visa. See more information about <A href="tc?module=Static&d1=tournaments&d2=tco07&d3=getVisa">travel visas</A>.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Travel Details</b><br>
TopCoder will provide air travel arrangements for each competitor. The flight reserved by and paid for by TopCoder is for arrival on June 26, 2007 and departure on June 30, 2007 (or July 1, 2007 if the cost is significantly less to fly out a day later).  TopCoder will pay for each competitor's airfare up to $1,500, though we may make exceptions based on individual circumstances (e.g., if the most reasonably convenient ticket itinerary is a little more than $1,500, TopCoder will pay for the entire cost).  Extended flights and/or hotel room nights requested by a competitor that result in additional costs will be the responsibility of the competitor and will be deducted from the competitor's total TCO prize money won. 
</p>
<p>
TopCoder will also provide ground transportation to and from McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, as well as hotel accommodations and certain meals for each contestant. All other expenses are the responsibility of the contestant. TopCoder will not provide travel or lodging accommodations for competitor guests at the 2007 TCO. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Room Assignment</b><br>
TopCoder will determine the room assignments for the Semifinal rooms prior to the start of each Semifinal round, in the following manner:
</p>
<p>
All competitors will be ordered by their tournament seed.  Starting with the highest seeded competitor and going down the list in order, a competitor will be assigned to room 1, then room 2, then room 3, then room 3 again, then room 2, then room 1.  This pattern will continue (1,2,3,3,2,1) until all competitors are assigned to a room.

<b>The Semifinal Round</b> will consist of three (3) rooms of sixteen (16) coders each. The two (2) highest scorers in each room will advance to the Championship Round. The next four (4) highest scorers in each room will participate in one (1) Wildcard Round. The two (2) highest scorers of the Wildcard Round will also advance to the Championship Round. 
</p>
<p>
<b>The Championship Round</b> will be a single round of eight (8) coders. Placement in the Championship Round is determined by comparing the total points of each coder. The winner of the Championship Round will be the coder with the highest point total for the round. In the event of a tie in the Semifinal, Wildcard and/or Championship Rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order): 
<ul>
<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during Online Rounds #2, #3 and #4 of the 2007 TopCoder Open</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then by rating (higher is better) following Online Round #4 
   <ul>
   <li>If a tie still remains in the Semifinal or Wildcard Rounds, then all tied coders will advance to the Championship Round</li>
   <li>If a tie still remains in the Championship Round, then the prize money will be distributed equally among the tied coders</li>
