<br><br>
<b>Thursday, October 13th 10:15AM - 10:45AM<br>
Hot Coffee with RFID</b><br>
RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) is one of the hot topics in the industry today.  Blending cutting edge technology into a small operation provides an interesting and exciting edge to the small business.  In this case study, TopCoder will illustrate how a future-facing coffee shop incorporated RFID technology into their ordering process.  A high level overview of the RFID benefits and pitfalls of the technology will be presented.
<br><br>
<b>2:15PM - 2:45PM<br>
Mobile Components and J2ME </b><br>
This session will discuss techniques for rapid development of applications for transferring and storing information on standards based J2ME-enabled phones, smart phones and other wireless devices. Focus will address why it is extremely important to provide a fast, efficient method to transfer data between the server and the handheld device.
<br><br>
<b>4:15PM - 4:45PM<br>
TopCoder Solutions: Identity & Access Management</b><br>
Most people think of security as restricting access to information, but when done correctly the greatest value is realized by increasing the flow of appropriate information to the appropriate people.
<br><br>
Learn how you can utilize TopCoder's Component-Based Methodology to provide a flexible, standardized based solution that helps you to enforce security policies, improve accessibility and reduce maintenance cost while working with industry leading security products. 
<br><br>
<b>Friday, October 14, 2005<br>
11:30AM - 12:00PM<br>
JavaServer Faces Round Table</b><br>
TopCoder Software project managers will host a round table discussion on the advantages of using JavaServer Faces components in your web application.  The conversation will focus on creating JSF components and integrating your custom JSF components with Java Studio Creator.  Learn about a great new emerging technology and one of the best tools to integrate the technology into your application.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">2005 TCO Component Competition</span><br>
The 2005 TopCoder Open Component tournament will run simultaneously with the Software Conference, allowing attendees the chance to observe competitors as they submit component designs that adhere to strict project specifications and development solutions for those designs. In addition, TopCoder's Architecture and Design Review Boards will be available onsite to discuss the peer review process and guidelines. 
<br><br>
"TopCoder Software is hosting a rare opportunity to interface for two days with some of the brightest developers in the industry and to discuss development issues facing application areas such as identity management, RFID and wireless," said Mike Morris, VP Software Development at TopCoder. "If your organization has invested in code reuse and is looking to dramatically shorten timelines and decrease costs, these workshops will outline the methodology and strategy for success."
