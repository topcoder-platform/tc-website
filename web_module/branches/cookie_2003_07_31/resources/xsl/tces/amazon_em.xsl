<p>Dear [handle]:</p>

<p>They've attracted talented people from all sorts of industries, with all sorts of work experience, to work on all sorts of new, 
interesting challenges. Their employees often tell them that a huge factor in their decision to join Amazon.com had to do with the 
quality of people they'd work with. Many tell them they offer their employees the opportunity to work side by side with some of 
the brightest, most passionate team members around.</p>

<p>Working with smart people, on challenging projects, in an environment high on responsibility and low on politics makes 
most people look forward to the workday. Add the fact that the work they're doing is truly changing the way people find and 
discover products, and you begin to see that much of the root of their enthusiasm comes from their desire to do something that's 
never been done before.</p>

<p>If you're ready to take the jump and join their team, check out the exciting positions waiting for you at 
Amazon.com: <A href="/?t=tces&amp;c=amazon" target="_blank">www.topcoder.com/?tces&amp;c=amazon</A></p>

<p>Thank you, and as always, good luck in the Arena!<br/>
The TopCoder Employment Services Team</p>
