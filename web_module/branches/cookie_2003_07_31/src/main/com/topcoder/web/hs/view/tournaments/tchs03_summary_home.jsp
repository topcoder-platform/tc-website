                        Tuesday, May 20, 2003</p>

                        <p>As the students began to arrive at the Homer Babbidge Library on the University of Connecticut campus, there seemed to be only 
                        one question on everyone's mind&#151;had <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=1800087" class="coderTextYellow">PolariStarII</a> 
                        shown up yet?  I couldn't tell which was more important to the competitors&#151;meeting the highest rated high school member 
                        in person or taking home the championship plaque for their school.  Once everyone signed in, however, and took their seats for the 
                        competition, it was clear that vying for the championship title was the &#35;1 priority.</p>

                        <p>The competition began as expected, with <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=1800087" class="coderTextYellow">PolariStarII</a> 
                        submitting his 250-point solution for an impressive 249.08 points.  His teammate, <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000319" class="coderTextYellow">lazira</a>, 
                        was in next, gaining 248.18 points for his 250-pointer.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000081" class="coderTextYellow">colgate</a> 
                        scored first for Norwich Free Academy (NFA) with 245.19 points on the 250; <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000003" class="coderTextBlue">MasterMargie</a> 
                        from Tolland wasn't far behind with his 245.01 points on the 250.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000099" class="coderTextBlue">TrueIdiotz</a> 
                        submitted NFA's second solution for 243.95 points on the 250-pointer, while <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000007" class="coderTextBlue">RanciD</a> 
                        scored next for Tolland with 243.89 points on the 250.</p>

                        <p><a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000255" class="coderTextYellow">mattvz</a> and <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000316" class="coderTextGray">Xzafire</a> 
                        were in next for Danbury and Northwest Catholic with 243.10 and 242.75 points, respectively.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000085" class="coderTextYellow">bahamutneo</a> 
                        submitted his 250-point solution for an additional 239.92 points for NFA.  Southington was on the board next, thanks to 
                        <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2058034" class="coderTextGreen">radishio's</a> 250-point solution worth 235.21 points.  
                        <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000310" class="coderTextBlue">noseBOY</a> followed quickly behind for Northwest Catholic 
                        with 234.22 points on his 250-pointer.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000113" class="coderTextGreen">Elyssium</a> 
                        submitted the 12th solution of the Coding Phase, earning 229.21 points for Southington.</p>

                        <p>Before the majority of the coders even submitted their first solutions, <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=1800087" class="coderTextYellow">PolariStarII</a> 
                        finished his 500-pointer, adding 449.05 points to Amity's total.  Another Amity coder, <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000352" class="coderTextYellow">nathanbp</a>, 
                        who started with the 500, scored 409.52 points for his submission.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000245" class="coderTextBlue">astyrrian</a> 
                        put Danbury on the board again with 201.61 points on the 250.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000327" class="coderTextGreen">goggles</a> 
                        put up the first points for Barlow with 225.69 points on the 250, while <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000319" class="coderTextYellow">lazira</a> 
                        came on strong with his 500-point submission for 428.84 points.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000241" class="coderTextBlue">alanschmitt</a> 
                        added another 180.01 points to Danbury's overall score with his 250-point submission.  
                        <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000352" class="coderTextYellow">nathanbp</a> made short work of the 250, receiving 247.29 
                        points for his submission.</p>

                        <p><a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000347" class="coderTextBlue">samwise</a> and

                        Barlow and Southington with 174.18 and 172.44 points, respectively.  After a bit of a drought, 
                        <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000009" class="coderTextBlue">Sellout</a> submitted Tolland's third set of points, 
                        earning 170.45 points on his 250.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000316" class="coderTextGray">Xzafire</a> chimed 
                        in again for Northwest Catholic with 367.83 points on his 500-pointer, while 
                        <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000081" class="coderTextYellow">colgate</a> was the first to score twice for NFA by earning 
                        338.86 points for her 500-point submission.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000368" class="coderTextGray">ksobel</a> 
                        put Stratford on the board with his 250-point submission for 146.54 points, and his teammate 
                        <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000314" class="coderTextGray">ownz0r</a> threw in the next submission, earning 314.28 
                        points for the 500.</p>

                        <p><a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000310" class="coderTextBlue">noseBOY</a> increased Northwest Catholic's point total by 
                        324.24 points for his 500-point submission.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000255" class="coderTextYellow">mattvz</a> 
                        made his way through the 500, adding 304.99 points to Danbury's total.  We finally heard from 
                        <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000341" class="coderTextGreen">Deathscythe</a>, representing Barlow, who earned 130.98 
                        points on his 250-pointer.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000003" class="coderTextBlue">MasterMargie</a> was right behind, 
                        giving Tolland 282.82 more points for his 500-point submission.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000085" class="coderTextYellow">bahamutneo</a> 
                        had the 31st submission of the Coding Phase and added 263.15 points to NFA's overall score.</p>

                        <p>No one was surprised to see <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=1800087" class="coderTextYellow">PolariStarII</a> submit the 
                        first 1000-pointer, increasing his and Amity's total by 584.36 points.  Tolland's <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000007" class="coderTextBlue">RanciD</a> 
                        was in next with his 500-point submission for 246.12 points.  Amity's last submission of the day came from 
                        <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000352" class="coderTextYellow">nathanbp</a>, who gained 583.03 points for his 1000-point solution.  
                        <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000099" class="coderTextBlue">TrueIdiotz</a> took his time before submitting his 500-point solution 
                        for 216.11 points for NFA.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000003" class="coderTextBlue">MasterMargie</a> had the most impressive 
                        submission of the day by earning 670.00 points for his 1000-point solution.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000368" class="coderTextGray">ksobel</a> 
                        submitted only the 3rd solution for the Stratford team, earning 275.64 points for the 500.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000245" class="coderTextBlue">astyrrian</a> 
                        scored last for Danbury, increasing the team's score by 207.00 points.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000310" class="coderTextBlue">noseBOY</a> 
                        submitted the last solution of the Coding Phase with only the 4th 1000-point submission for 390.95 points.</p>

                        <p>The top 5 scores at the end of the coding phase were as follows:</p>

                        their team's highest scorer, and the highest scoring female of the competition.</p>

                        <p>Not surprisingly, Amity walked away with the championship plaque.  <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=2000352" class="coderTextYellow">nathanbp</a> 
                        pulled a bit of an upset by besting <a href="?module=Statistics&c=member_profile&cr=1800087" class="coderTextYellow">PolariStarII</a> as the highest scorer for their team.</p>
