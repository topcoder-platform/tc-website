<P><B>Students advance to TopCoders finals</B><BR/><BR/>
April 8, 2002<BR/>

<P>Computer programming can still be profitable in today's weakened economy, three Stanford students recently proved. The graduate students were all named finalists in a national programming contest and will compete for a top prize of $100,000.</P>
<P>Coterminal computer science student Daniel Wright and doctoral candidates in computer science, Eugene Davydov and Ante Derek, are three of 16 finalists in the 2002 Sun Microsystems and TopCoder Collegiate Challenge tournament. The competition will be at the University Park Hotel at MIT on April 19 and 20.</P>
<P>ÒObviously, we're very excited to have these three Stanford University students among the final 16 of our second Collegiate Challenge," said Jack Hughes, TopCoder founder and chairman. ÒIt should be noted that they have scaled steep odds to get to this point. Out of over 500 of the country's best developers, they have made it to the final 16. The competition has been fierce, and we wish all three the best of luck in the finals."</P>
<P>TopCoder organizes competitions for programmers from all over the nation to try their skills against each other.</P>
<P>Each participant's score is determined in two ways: an objective scoring from the TopCoder system and a challenge phase in which any contestant can challenge any other contestant's code for errors. Therefore, the ability to write good code is just as important as the ability to write code quickly.</P>
<P>All the finalists have demonstrated mastery of these skills, but Wright seems to be in the best position, as he entered the tournament as the second seed in the west. He also is the only TopCoder member to ever make it to the semifinals of each of TopCoder's first three major tournaments and he was the runner-up in the 2001 TopCoder Invitational. During his time as a member of TopCoder, Wright has won a total of $41,991 in three types of competitions: the Collegiate Challenge, the Invitational and the company's weekly single-round matches.</P>
<P>ÒI enjoy coding and I enjoy competition Ñ perhaps in the same way that many people enjoy competitive sports," Wright said. ÒEspecially given that I am now familiar with most of the highly ranked TopCoder members, I enjoy matching my skills against theirs. I like the recognition that I believe this will bring when I look for jobs. Of course, I also like the substantial prize money Ñ that is perhaps the main factor that has kept me competing for so long."</P>
<P>Hughes agrees that TopCoder helps students find jobs since it rewards the most talented in the programming field.</P>
<P>ÒGiven the pedigree of these outstanding students, it is clear that we have identified the future leaders of software development and the technology industry," he said. ÒTopCoder has over 6,000 collegiate members. These 16 [finalists] have put in a tremendous effort in order to elevate above a crowded field of the best and the brightest. The energy and excitement during the online elimination rounds was amazing. We look forward to seeing them all at MIT in April."</P>
<P>Wright encourages interested students to compete.</P>
<P>ÒI know many people who thought they had no chance of doing well, so they didn't compete for a long time," he said. ÒBut when they did start, they did very well."</P>
