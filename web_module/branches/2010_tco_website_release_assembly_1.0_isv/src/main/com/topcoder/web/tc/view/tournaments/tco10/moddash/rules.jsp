                            <h3 class="subTitle">Competition Scoring</h3><!-- sub title-->
                            <p>Scoring in the Mod Dash Competition is determined based on the amount of points earned in a Tournament-eligible Mod Dash competition in accordance with the rules of each such competition.  A Mod Dash competition is Tournament-eligible if the competition is identified as being included as part of the Tournament.  Only Competitors who are registered for the Tournament will earn points towards the Mod Dash Competition.</p>
                            <p>Upon the completion of all Tournament-eligible Mod Dash competitions, the individual scores that a Competitor receives during the Mod Dash Competition Period will be added for a cumulative score.  Up to ten (10) Competitors with the highest cumulative score greater than zero will advance to the Onsite Championship Round ("Onsite Mod Dash Competitors").</p>

Placement will be determined by adding the point totals of each Competitor upon conclusion of all of the Championship Rounds together and comparing them.</p>
