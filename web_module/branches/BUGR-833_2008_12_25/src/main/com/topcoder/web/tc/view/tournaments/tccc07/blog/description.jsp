<p>
For this year's TopCoder Collegiate Challenge, we're looking for two bloggers who can convey the behind-the-scenes experience of attending an onsite tournament - and can broadcast it to members in a creative way. 
</p>

<p>
To win a trip to Orlando, we want to see how you apply your perspective to a situation. We want to see the humor and humanity that you can find, the unique angles and ideas you can come up with, and the creative techniques that you have in your arsenal. 
</p>

<p>
When you get to the TCCC, we're planning to give you a video camera and set you loose - you could post your videos directly to members, or contribute to our TC Channel broadcasts as a "roving reporter." While we'll be looking primarily for video, you'll also be free to submit some of your entries in other formats, depending on what you think will work best to convey the story - a mix of text, photos, videos, etc. 
</p>

<p>
Since it's a pretty wide-open blogging experience, we're looking for whatever you think you can do the best. If it's text, feel free to send up to a maximum of 500 words; if it's a mix of other media, or a video, or whatever, send that instead - the sky's the limit! (You should feel free to embed multimedia links into your submission.)
</p>

<p>
Check out the Spec Doc for more ideas on what we're looking for.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Entries must be your original work, and must not infringe on the copyright or licenses of others.</strong>

<h3>Selection of the Winner</h3>

<p>
Up to ten (10) submissions will be chosen by TopCoder and presented to the community for a vote. The voting will begin at 2:00 PM EDT (GMT/UTC -4) on Thursday, September 20, 2007 and will end at 2:00 PM EDT (GMT/UTC -4) on Friday, September 21, 2007. TopCoder will use the Schulze Method to determine the winner based on the voting by the community. The community will be asked to rank the ten (10) submissions from 1 to 10 (one being the most favorite and ten being the least favorite). For an explanation of the Schulze method, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method</a>. In the event of a tie when voting is complete, TopCoder will choose between the tied submissions and the prize money will be distributed equally among the tied competitors.
