<span class="greenSubtitle">Summary of the Tournament</span><br>
The Google&#153; Code Jam Europe 2006 is being offered by Google, Inc. ("Google") and TopCoder, Inc. ("TopCoder"). Google always focuses on creating innovative technologies that could benefit ordinary people’s lives. The goal of this contest is to encourage and reward the top talents in computer science in Europe. The Code Jam Europe will take place between May 1, 2006 and June 29, 2006. It begins with an online registration, after which all registered individuals will participate in a Qualification Round to determine who will compete in the programming tournament. The tournament consists of one (1) online qualification round, two (2) online elimination rounds and one (1) onsite final round. The top 250 scores from Round 2 will receive a Google Code Jam Europe t-shirt. In addition, Google will award &#8364;30,000 in cash and prizes to the 50 finalists in the tournament.<br><br>
<b>Eligibility</b><br>
All individuals who are legal residents of <a href="/pl/?module=Static&d1=gecj06&d2=europe">Europe</a>, <a href="/pl/?module=Static&d1=gecj06&d2=africa">Africa</a> and the <a href="/pl/?module=Static&d1=gecj06&d2=mideast">Middle East</a> may register and compete in the Google Code Jam Europe 2006 provided they physically reside in an eligible country from May 1 through June 29, 2006. Please note that due to potential visa restrictions, some finalists may not be able to participate at the on-site finals in Dublin, Ireland.
<br><br>
Registrants who are 13 years of age or older as of May 23, 2006 may compete in the Qualification and Online Rounds of the Google Code Jam Europe 2006. Only participants who are 18 years of age or older as of May 23, 2006 are eligible to compete in the Championship Round and win prizes (cash or products), unless otherwise prohibited. The Google Code Jam Europe 2006 is void where prohibited by applicable law. Prizes, including t-shirts, will not be paid to residents of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan or Syria.
<br><br>
Full and part-time employees of Google and TopCoder, as well as those who are performing internships at Google from May 1 through June 29, 2006 and those involved in the production (including prize suppliers), implementation and distribution of this tournament and their advertising or promotion agencies, parent companies, service providers, agents, officers, subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other persons or entities directly associated with the tournament and members of the immediate families and/or persons living in the same household as such persons, are ineligible to enter the tournament.
<br><br>
<b>Registration</b><br>
Registration will open on Monday, May 1, 2006 at 8:00AM GMT/UTC and will close on Tuesday, May 23, 2006 at 8:00AM GMT/UTC. There is no limit to the number of registrants for the competition; however each individual may only register once.
<br><br>
<b>Qualification Round</b><br>
The Qualification Round will be open for 24 hours from 11:00AM GMT/UTC on Tuesday, May 23, 2006 through 11:00AM GMT/UTC on Wednesday, May 24, 2006.
<br><br>
The Qualification Round will consist of two phases: the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase.
<ul>
	<li>The Qualification Round Coding Phase is a timed event where contestants are presented with one
		of five possible problem sets. Each problem set contains two questions representing two levels
		of complexity and, accordingly, two levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question
		are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based
		on the total time elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.
		Competitors will have 60 minutes to complete either or both of the problems. The 60 minutes will
		begin to elapse once the first problem is opened. The timer in the coding window will count down
		to the end of the 60 minutes. A competitor who begins the qualification attempt within the final
		60 minutes of the Qualification Round will have less than 60 minutes to attempt
		qualification.</li>
	<li>The Qualification Round System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code. If the TopCoder
		System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the
		points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a
		set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a
		coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The
		same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given
		question.</li>
</ul>
The Qualification Round will contain ten (10) virtual rooms and five (5) problem sets. The top 100
scorers from each of the five problem sets presented during the Qualification Round will be eligible to
compete in Round 1 of the Code Jam Europe.
<br><br>
<b>The Competition Field</b><br>
Up to 500 individuals will qualify to compete in Round 1.  The top 250 scorers from Round 1 will advance to online Round 2.  The top 50 scorers from Round 2 will advance to the onsite Championship Round.

<span class="greenSubtitle">About the Tournament</span><br>
<b>Use of Plugins in the Competition Arena</b><br>
The use of external TopCoder Arena plugins or any modifications to the TopCoder Arena functionality is strictly
prohibited.
<br><br>
<b>Online Elimination Rounds</b><br>
Everyone who competes in the online elimination rounds must log in to the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than ten minutes prior to the
start of the online round. All start times will be communicated as GMT/UTC, so contestants in other time zones must
adjust accordingly. If a coder does not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she has advanced to, it will
be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition.
<br><br>
All competitors who have been invited to compete will be randomly assigned to specific rooms, with up to 10 people in
each room. TopCoder will determine all room assignments prior to the start of each online round.
<br><br>
<b>Scoring and Advancing</b><br>
After each round of competition, the top scorers will be identified and will advance to the next round. Coder
advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round for each
coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater-than-zero) point total. The
structure of the online rounds is as follows:
<br><br>
<b>Round 1 (online)</b><br>
Up to 500 coders will compete in Round 1. The 250 highest scoring competitors will advance to Round 2. Each coder must have positive points to advance, so if there are less than 250 competitors who score positive points, only those competitors with a positive point total will advance.
<br><br>
<b>Round 2 (online)</b><br>
Up to 250 coders will compete in Round 2. The 50 highest scoring competitors will advance to the Championship Round. Each coder must have positive points to advance, so if there are less than 50 competitors who score positive points, only those competitors with a positive point total will advance.
<br><br>

<b>NOTE:</b> In the event of a tie for any advancing position (positive points only), all tied coders will advance to the Championship Round. 
<br><br>

<b>Competition Round Structure</b><br>
Round 1, Round 2 and the Championship Round (excluding the Qualification Round) consists of three phases: the Coding
Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. The Qualification Round will consist only of the Coding Phase and
System Testing Phase. (See "Qualification Round" above for details regarding the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase
of the Qualification Round.)
<ul>
<li>The Coding Phase is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing
three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question are
awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time
elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.</li>
<li>The Challenge Phase is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of
other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points
by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger. Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point
reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.</li>
<li>The System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If
the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the
points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs,
expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not
match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be
applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be
added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</li>
</ul>

<b>Onsite Championship Round</b><br>
Up to 50 advancers from Round 2 will compete in the onsite Championship Round of the tournament being held on Thursday, June 29, 2006. Google will contact all finalists for travel information.
<br><br>
Google will provide all travel accommodations for each finalist to attend the Championship Round. In addition, Google will provide overnight accommodations and all travel arrangements to and from the airport, as well as to and from the onsite round facility. All other expenses are the responsibility of the contestant.
<br><br>
The Championship Round will be a single round of 50 coders. Placement in the Championship Round is determined by comparing the total points of each coder. The winner of the Championship Round will be the coder with the highest point total for the round. In the event of a tie in the Championship Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order):
<ul>
<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during online Round 2.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then by total points acquired (higher is better) during online Round 1.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then the prize money will be distributed equally among the tied coders.</li>
</ul>
<a name="prizes"></a>
<span class="greenSubtitle">About the Prizes</span><br>
The top 250 scores from Round 2 will receive a "Google Code Jam Europe" t-shirt. In addition, the 50 finalists in the Championship Round will receive prizes. Any and all applicable taxes on prizes are the sole responsibility of the prizewinner. Prizes will be distributed as follows:
