For those of you that have never met your fellow TopCoders in person, sometimes the profile pictures can be misleading.  For instance, when I arrived on Tuesday, I didn't recognize <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8416646" darkBG="true" />; his hair is much longer in person than in his profile picture (understandable because people don't constantly update their profile picture on TopCoder).  
<br /><br />
Since most of the blogs have been about the contest and what code people have written, this entry is a break from the code.  Anyway, some of the profile pictures don't do these competitors justice, so I have taken the liberty of taking some candid photographs to truly represent the TopCoder competitors (you can check the website for other candid photos taken by the TopCoder staff). Since we're all in competition mode, another one won't hurt...
<br /><br />
<strong>Competition 1: Best Sock/Sandal Combo</strong>
<br /><br />
I was talking to <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8416646" darkBG="true" /> yesterday about his love for the sock/sandal combo.  He even wore sandals in the winter...in Denver!  Obviously his feet wouldn't have survived the harsh winter snow of Colorado without... SOCKS! <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8416646" darkBG="true" /> and others must have posted on the forum of the convenience of the sock/sandal combo because a lot of the competitors are sportin' it.  Who do you think looks the best? (Sorry for those of you that could not enter the competition... some of you guys were too busy actually COMPETING in a round.)
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/omgrace-05-01.jpg" /></div>
<br /><br />
I give <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8416646" darkBG="true" /> points for wearing the Teva/sock combo - it takes an extra 3 seconds to get the Velcro together, so props to you!
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/omgrace-05-02.jpg" /></div>
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="8365685" darkBG="true" /> gets bonus points for matching his socks and his shirt....w00t!
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/omgrace-05-03.jpg" /></div>
<br /><br />
I like <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8357090" darkBG="true" />'s candid pose.  I had to take these pictures without them noticing...otherwise they might not have entered my AWESOME contest!  
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/omgrace-05-04.jpg" /></div>
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="7210680" darkBG="true" /> - he might get a couple of extra points because he has the athletic sock combined with the sandal.  And last but not least...
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/omgrace-05-05.jpg" /></div>
<br /><br />
I can't say much about <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10574855" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11829284" darkBG="true" />'s picture...except that they are a double threat to all of the other competitors.  
<br /><br />
So what are your thoughts, readers?  They're all winners in my book, but I think team double threat wins best sock/sandal combo.  Congrats!
<br /><br />
<strong>Competition 2: Best Hair</strong>
<br /><br />
I know you're thinking, what the heck?! But seriously, some of these guys have pretty interesting hair styles, and their profile pics really don't do them justice....
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/omgrace-05-06.jpg" /></div>
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="7338095" darkBG="true" /> reminds me a little of Kramer from Seinfeld... and it's all natural!
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/omgrace-05-07.jpg" /></div>
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="8355516" darkBG="true" /> almost has the longest hair, plus he has the edge of the matching beard...
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/omgrace-05-04.jpg" /></div>
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="7210680" darkBG="true" /> is double entered!  He didn't win the best sock/sandal contest, but is definitely a front-runner for the best hair contest...
<br /><br />
In my opinion, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7338095" darkBG="true" /> wins best hair for this year's TopCoder Open.  While the others all had great style, I liked <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7338095" darkBG="true" />'s because it's the most creative.  
<br /><br />
So there you have it!  Now you have a better idea of what the competitors look like instead of their outdated profile photos.  I'm sure <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7338095" darkBG="true" /> wouldn't mind sharing his styling secrets with everyone...
<br /><br />
I'll be back later this afternoon with another update -- and just think, only a couple more hours until you see <tc-webtag:handle coderId="272072" darkBG="true" /> in a DDR competition!
