<P><B>FOR SPONSORS</B><BR>
TopCoder High School provides sponsoring companies the ability to proactively and directly support and promote high school math and science programs within their communities.  It also allows companies to reach a desirable and targeted market of high school consumers and their families.  Sponsorship of these academically competitive events may further position a company as a leader in the community and provide benefit to those students who previously had no "playing field" to showcase their skills.</P>

<P>Three sponsorship packages are available to companies.  The investment and benefits of each package are as follows:</P>

                        <!--TopCoder HighSchool is fast becoming the major league for programming competitions. TopCoder brings members together once a week to compete online (Single Round Match) and twice a year both online and on location (Tournaments).</P>

<P><B>Why Online Competitions</B><BR>
Competitions provide an understanding of a person's capabilities through a demonstration of skill. What was lacking in the world of programming competitions was a format that offered immediate and objective scoring. The solution was the creation of a "Single Round Match".</P>

<P>In order to drive repeated participation, TopCoder developed "Tournaments" that offer larger cash prizes to the members who successfully code their way through weekly Single Round Matches and build a rating that puts them in a seeding for either the Invitational Tournament (open to all members) or Collegiate Challenge (open to college students only).</P>

<P><B>Who Benefits</B></P>

<P><B>Members</B><BR>
Each Single Round Match offers a fun, time-based, and challenging set of problems that put a developer's skills to the test. TopCoder is in the process of establishing Teams. This coupled with the new Divisions will offer a more level field of competition for newer members in order to build ratings and move into potential tournament opportunities.</P>


<P><B>Sponsors</B>
Reaching the developer community is a difficult task at best. Marketing budgets are limited and with the advent of the Internet, the expectation for measuring results has only grown. TopCoder offers companies a means of targeting this desired community through the targeted sponsorship of Single Round Matches and Tournaments.</P>-->
