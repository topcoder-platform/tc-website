                            <h2>What is TopCoder Studio?</h2>

                            <p>
                                TopCoder Studio challenges top creative minds from around the world to present their
                                best graphic and web design concepts to clients searching for a unique user-based
                                perspective. By tapping into the talent of creative people with multiple specialties,
                                new approaches and innovative concepts rise to the top. During engaging competitions,
                                Studio members have just the right mix of client guidance, TopCoder Studio support, and
                                creative freedom to break down barriers common in traditional client-designer
                                relationships.
                            </p>

                            <h2>The Competition Process</h2>

                            <p>
                                The competition process ignites creativity in both the client and the Studio members.
                                TopCoder determines the needs of the client, presents those needs to the Studio
                                member-base, and administers all aspects of the competition.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Contest specifications are posted on Studio and members submit their designs according
                                to those specs. Submissions are then screened against the contest specifications by the
                                Contest Administrator and either passed or failed. Passing submissions are presented to
                                the client. The client can then chose to determine a winner on their own, ask the
                                community to chose a winner through a vote, or enter into a review and revision phase
                                with finalists they select, selecting a winner after the revisions are completed.
