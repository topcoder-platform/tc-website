                        <p>Yahoo! is excited to sponsor the TopCoder Open and support the drive, intensity and innovative spirit of TopCoder members. We know a lot about you and we're impressed (to say the least). We hope you'll get to know a bit about us too.</p>

						<p class="bodySubtitle">Why Yahoo!?</p>
 
						<p>What started in 1994 as two Stanford Ph. D. students in a trailer, has quickly become the world's most essential Internet service for consumers, as well as businesses. Over the past ten years, Yahoo! has established itself as the proven leader - reaching over 300 million unique users in 26 countries - but we never rest on our laurels. We're always looking ahead and need the smartest engineers in the world to drive our future. Yep, that's you.</p>

						<p class="bodySubtitle">What keeps us yodeling?

						<p>Yahoo!'s mission is to be the most essential global Internet service for consumers and businesses. How we pursue that mission is influenced by our core values. Many of these were put into practice years ago by our founders, David Filo and Jerry Yang, and others reflect ambitions as our company grows. All of them are what we strive to achieve everyday.</p>

						<p>	Excellence<br/>
							Innovation<br/>
							Customer Fixation<br/>
							Teamwork<br/>
							Community<br/>
							And last, but not least...Fun</p>

						<p class="bodySubtitle">Where do you fit in to the picture?</p>

						<p>Relentless innovation, groundbreaking technology and worldwide influence are just a few of the reasons engineers love working at Yahoo!. (The free coffee, game room breaks and jeans-and-t-shirt atmosphere don't hurt either.)</p>
