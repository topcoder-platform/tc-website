<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<p><span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The SMC (Site Management Console) is a Server Client Application which allows users to create Calendar Entries and create reports.</p>
<p>The Site Management Console is necessary to coordinate and organize different marketing and sales activities to create on time new landing pages for an eCommerce site.</p>
<p>The customer is holding weekly meetings and is using the created reports as meeting material.</p>
<p>The application has three main parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating, changing and deleting different events like:
<ul>
	<li>Content</li>
	<li>Digital Operations</li>
	<li>Corporate Marketing</li>
	<li>Marketing</li>
	<li>Merchandising</li>
	<li>Planning</li>
	<li>Technology</li>
	<li>Non-Landing Pages</li>
	<li>Landing Page</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Creating Reports</li>
<li>Printing the calendars and reports in different layouts</li>
</ol>

<p>This testing competition will deal with creating, changing and deleting non-landing page events.</p>

<p><span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
The application described above is currently being created. But the GUI prototype (in a form of .NET WinForms application) already exists. The competitors in this competition will create a set of automated test cases that will verify that the application is implemented according to the requirements documentation. The application has been divided into small, logical sections. This competition represents the test cases for one section of this application. For section, a minimum set of test scenarios has already been created. It is recommended that additional tests are also created.</p>
