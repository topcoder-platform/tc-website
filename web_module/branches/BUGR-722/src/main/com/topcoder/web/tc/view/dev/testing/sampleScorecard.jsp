<br><br>
Score each statement below using the values in the Key.  Where appropriate, provide comments on the reason for the score in the space below each line item.  For each score use the following Key [1 = Disagree, 2 = Somewhat Agree, 3 = Agree, 4 = Strongly Agree]. Comments are required for all line items.   For each comment, please state whether it is a Required or Recommended modification, or simply a comment in the right hand column.  The Overall Weight label depicts how much the score of that question affects the overall scorecard score.

<strong>The implementation code contains detailed documentation for classes, written in Javadoc / XML style as required by the Java / C# coding standards.</strong><br>
The reviewer should look at this from an application developer standpoint. Test suite documentation should contain a description of the class and its purpose. The documentation should emphasize how the test will be used.<br>
1 - Documentation is missing for one or more tests or it proves to be consistently unhelpful. The documentation provided by the developer does not clarify how most of the tests will be used, by providing simple comments that do not bring additional value to the name of the test.<br>
2 - Documentation exists for each test in the the suite but it provides little help to the developer; it is missing details regarding the way a test is intended to be used.<br>
3 - Documentation is complete and adequate to test the application but requires further minor clarifications in several situations.<br>
4 - Documentation is complete and provides full details to the application developer using this test suite. The developer will likely not require any other details on how the tests will be ran.<br>

<strong>The implementation code contains detailed documentation for methods, written in Javadoc / XML style as required by the Java / C# coding standards.</strong><br>

All required tags defining parameters, return type and exceptions should be present and correctly describe method details.<br>
1 - Documentation is consistently missing or consistently unhelpful. A majority of the methods either lack documentation or do not provide required details.<br>
2 - Documentation is missing on at least one method or provides little help to the developer.<br>
3 - Documentation is complete and adequate to test the application but may require further clarifications.<br>

<strong>The implementation code contains detailed documentation. </strong><br>
The reviewer should look at this from a future maintenance developer standpoint. This issue also ensures that there are no useless comments that pollute source code and make it hard to understand. At a minimum, the developer should provide meaningful comments for blocks of code in methods, describing what it is trying to do, the assumptions made and the way it is done.<br>
1 - Documentation is consistently missing or consistently not helpful.<br>
2 - Documentation is missing in at least one important algorithm / code block or consistently provides little help to the developer. Documentation contains useless comments that do not provide any value to the implementation, but only make it harder to read / understand.<br>
3 - Documentation is complete and adequate to understand the implementation, but there may be several places where it can further be enhanced with useful details, or simplified by removing useless comments.<br>
4 - Documentation is clear, complete and concise, helping in clarifying implementation decisions and details.<br>

<strong>There are no errors and no warnings while generating the Javadoc / XML documentation.</strong><br>
That means the documentation must be perfect from a syntactical point of view. There should be no missing tags, no additional tags, not even for private members or inner classes. Tools such as javadoc, Checkstyle or features of the modern IDEs should be used to check it.<br>
No - The documentation misses documentation tags or generates warnings and errors for different other reasons.<br>
Yes - The documentation is correct and complete.<br>

<strong>Unit Test Cases test all methods and constructors.</strong><br>
The reviewer should verify if for each public method and constructor defined by the in the component interface diagram, the developer provided test methods. The reviewer should focus on the existence of the test methods, instead of focusing on their quality.<br>
1 - Most of the test methods are missing or the existing test methods incorrectly test the functionality of the application.<br>
2 - The submission does not contain test methods for trivial functionality of the component, such as set / get methods or exception constructors. However, this does not appear to be a pattern throughout the unit testing.<br>
3 - There is at least one test method for each public method and constructor.<br>
4 - There are several test methods for each public method and constructor.<br>

<strong>Where applicable, Unit Test Cases properly make use of setup and teardown methods to configure the test environment.  </strong><br>

No - Temporary files are left on the file system or database / network connections are not closed after testing is complete.<br>
Yes - Temporary files are removed from the file system after testing is complete and temporary files are created only when needed.<br>
