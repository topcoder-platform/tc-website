<h2><div>Getting your Visa and Getting it Early</div></h2>
<h3>Do I need a visa?</h3>
<p>
All travelers entering the United States must present either a passport or a visa. If you do NOT have a passport, or you are from a country that does NOT participate in the Visa Waiver Program, you must apply for a visa.
</p>
<p>
The following countries DO NOT require a visa to enter the United States:<br>
<a href="<tc-webtag:linkTracking link='http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/without/without_1990.html' refer='TCHS07_VISA' />">http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/without/without_1990.html#countries</a>
</p>
<h3>Why Should I Get it Early?</h3>
<p>
Getting your travel documents well in advance of your travel dates is important. If you require a visa, the application process could be lengthy. In some countries, it can take over a month. We strongly suggest you begin the process as soon as possible. 
</p>
<h3>What is involved in applying for a visa?</h3>
<p>
The visa application process is an interview at the US Embassy explaining your trip to the United States.  You should apply for a travel/tourist visa and be sure to let them know that you are only staying in the United States for a short time.  It's a good idea to have the following information available at your interview: 
</p>
<ul>
   <li>An official letter of invitation from TopCoder (please see below)</li>
   <li>Proof of residency in your home country </li>
   <li>Evidence of employment and community ties, such as a copy of your marriage license or school documents </li>
   <li>Your resume </li>
</ul>
<h3>How do I get an official invitation letter from TopCoder?</h3>
<p>
After Online Round 2 of each region, competitors advancing to Round 3 will receive a request form to fill out.  As soon as a competitor fills out the form in entirety, their letter will be shipped out by FedEx International Priority mail.  Competitors have until 5:00 PM EDT (GMT/UTC -4) on Wednesday, April 11, 2007 to request a letter.
