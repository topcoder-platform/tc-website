<span class="bigTitle">Warehouse Management Phase 1 Warehouse Functions</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The Warehouse Management System project will increase productivity at TopCoder's client, cut costs drastically, and provide them with real time, on- demand reports.

The Warehouse Functions portion of the application covers all the movements of a product.  There are four basic movements:
<ul>
<li>Transfer - Moving either a carton, gaylord (a very large box), or a pallet from one location to another.  This is usually done when items are ready to be moved to a warehouse or if they are sold and being shipped to a customer.</li>
<li>Trailer Transfer - Moving a whole trailer from one location to another.  This is usually done to either process or ship the item in the trailer.</li>
<li>Reduction/Addition - Either removing or adding items to an existing carton or pallet.  This is usually done when an item has been sold.</li>
<li>Consolidation - Combining two pallets into one. This is done when pallet locations are needed.</li>
</ul>

Application administration will also be included here. These are simply screens set up to maintain item and location attributes.
<br><br>
