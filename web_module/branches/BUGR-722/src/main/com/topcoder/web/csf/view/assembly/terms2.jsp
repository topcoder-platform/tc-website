<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>
British Telecom is the largest telecommunications provider in the UK, and one of the largest communications providers globally, providing managed voice and data services to clients in over 150 countries globally. BT is undergoing a complete transformation. At the heart of this transformation is a $20 billion 21st century network (21CN) initiative. An IP-based, multi-service network, 21CN is the driver for a radical change in how consumers and business interact.
</p>
<p>
As part of this project, you are tasked with creating a mashup prototype application that integrates BT's ground-breaking network Web Services (code-named Web21C) with the raw power of Microsoft's Connected Services Framework (CSF) components.
</p>
<p>
Mashing together <a href="http://web21c.bt.com/">BT Services</a>, <a href="/">Microsoft CSF</a>, <a href="http://software.topcoder.com/catalog/index.jsp">TopCoder Components</a>, and third party Web services and content (as long as it is free and publicly available for commercial use), you can unleash your ideas, your curiosities, and your talents towards prototyping a usable mashup.
</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p>
Develop a prototype application based upon the winning submission from the BT Workspace Mashup Design Competition. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Your submission must include functionality from the BT Business Workspace Mashup Design Competition (See the Documentation section)</li>
<li>The prototype mashup application must run within the CSF Sandbox.</li>
<li>Application entries must be your original work but based on the BT Business Workspace Mashup Design. The prototype must not infringe on the copyright or licenses of others.</li>
<li>The target market is small and medium sized companies, which typically do not have large technical teams or highly technical users. The judges will be looking for assembly prototypes which maximize the ease of use of the Wiki environment for non-technical users, both in the administration and in the entry. The critical judging parameter will be the simplification of the use of the system in a Workspace environment.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prize Structure</strong></p>
<p>
The contest will award cash prizes totaling $12,250 to up to three (3) competitors, with a possibility of additional discretionary prizes. Any and all applicable taxes on prizes are the sole responsibility of the prizewinner(s).
</p>
<p><strong>
Prize 1: $7,000.00<br>
Prize 2: $3,500.00<br>
Prize 3: $1,750.00 
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discretionary Prizes</strong></p>
<p>
BT may choose at its discretion to have more winners than the three outlined above. In such cases, the above competition terms would apply and prize monies would be determined within the above range.
</p>
<p><strong>Final Deliverables From Winner</strong></p>
<p>
The payment will be distributed in one full installment once the final version of the winning submission has been received by TopCoder. The winner must deliver the following final files: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Full sources for the mashup implementation.</li>
<li>A VS.NET solution file or NAnt build script set up to fully build the mashup implementation.</li>
<li>A document in RTF format explaining how to set up any dependency services or components, and deploy the application to the CSF sandbox. This document should also contain a section listing any and all TopCoder components that were used in the prototype.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are the BT Web Services?</h2>

<p>
The Web Services that are available enable designers and developers to access the power of BT's network to add powerful communications capabilities to applications:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Short Message Service</strong> - The Short Message Service (SMS) allows you to send SMS messages.</li>
<li><strong>Voice Call</strong> - The Voice Call service allows you to place phone calls from their application.</li>
<li><strong>Conference Call</strong> - The Conference Call service allows you to place and control conference calls.</li>
<li><strong>Presence</strong> - The Presence service allows you to store and retrieve an users' current status and availability for communication.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong> - The Authentication service allows you to create and control an authentication realm for an application. This includes management and authentication of users.</li>
<li><strong>Information About Me</strong> - The Information About Me (IAM) service allows you to store and retrieve data about an individual in key value pairs.</li>
<li>More information about these services, along with examples, are listed here: <a href="http://web21c.bt.com">http://web21c.bt.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Common Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>What is a "Mashup"?</strong>
<br />A mashup is a hybrid Web application that has been combined from two or more Web services, and that provides an entirely different solution from either of the two disparate services.</li>
<li><strong>What is a "Managed Network Mashup"?</strong>
<br />Web services are combined with traditional telecommunications offerings, and then can be offered through the Software as a Service (SaaS) model and delivered across virtually any type of network or device.</li>
<li><strong>What is British Telecom (BT)?</strong>
<br />British Telecom (BT) is the largest telecommunications provider in the United Kingdom and one of the largest communications providers globally, providing managed voice and data services to clients in over 150 countries globally. BT is undergoing a complete 	transformation and at the heart of this change is a 21st century network initiative (21CN) 	costing nearly $20 billion. 21CN is an IP-based, multi-service network and will be the 	driver for radical change in the telecommunications industry.</li>
