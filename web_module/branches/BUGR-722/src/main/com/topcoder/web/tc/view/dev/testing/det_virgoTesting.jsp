<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>

<p><span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The application consists of a set of command-line tools for the processing of custom data sets. Each tool performs a specific role in the process; they can be called individually or in sequence to run the process entirely.
</p>

<p><span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
An inventory of test scenarios and detailed test cases are provided to ensure that the application meets all of the defined requirements.  This goal of this competition is to generate the test code for all automatable tests in the inventory.  The tests built by this competition will be used to validate the assembled application for QA and Deployment.
</p>

<p>The main tasks will involve:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Writing NUnit test code</li>
    <li>Creating NAnt tasks to compile and run the test cases</li>
    <li>Providing directions for configuration and running of test cases</li>
</ul>

<p>Documentation and Application that will be provided to Registered Constants:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Test Case Scenario Inventory</em></li>
<li><em>Test input and output files</em></li>
</ul>


<div class="sectionHeader">Submission Deliverables</div>

<p>
The list below defines the deliverables for the competition:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Test cases source code</li>
<li>Configuration files and resource bundles for test cases</li>
<li>NAnt tasks to compile and run tests</li>
<li>Any instructions required to configure / run tests</li>
<li>README document describing package, tests, and instructions for executing compile and test build files</li>
</ul>

<p>
All submissions should be submitted in a zip file named:
</p>
<pre>
[Member Handle]_VirgoTesting_[root directory name].zip
</pre>
<p>
To ensure the test code and the configuration files can be easily associated to the inventory of test case scenarios, tests should adhere to the following naming conventions:
</p>
<pre>
<strong>Methods:</strong>
      Test&lt;Test Case ID&gt; - The "Test Case ID" refers to the "Number" column 
        in the Test Case Scenario Inventory.  |
      Example: Test15()</pre>
<p>
NOTE: Test case scenarios should be broken into a series of tests with a single assertion per method whenever possible. When single assertion test methods are achievable, the method naming convention must be extended to include additional detail pertaining to that specific test.
</p>
<pre>
      Example: Test15_ValidateMapOutput()

<strong>Configuration/Resources:</strong>
       &lt;Module&gt;_&lt;Test Case ID&gt;_&lt;Property&gt;
       Example: DOWNLOAD_15_COMMAND
               DOWNLOAD_25_MAPOUTFILE</pre>

<pre>
[Member Handle]_VirgoTesting_[application section]
    Application

            CSharp
                Test

                        Contains the file used in testing
</pre>

<p><strong>NAnt Task</strong><br />
Each submission should implement two nant tasks. These nant tasks will be executed in the build.xml  file that is include in the zip file of the application source code.  Below are templates for these tasks.
</p>

<p><strong>Compile &amp; Build NAnt Task</strong><br />
Below is an example NAnt build file that compiles and executes the Tests for one of the five applications.  A build file should be created for building and compiling each of the applications; additionally, a build file should be created which calls each of the five build files, allowing the compilation and execution of all tests.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;

&lt;project name="Test1Test" default="build" basedir="."&gt;

<div class="sectionHeader">How the submission Test Cases will be executed during review</div>

<p>
After the submission phase is complete, all submission will be tested against test assemblies, as the assemblies will not have been completed.  Test executables will be provided which will simulate the behavior of the different types of tests.   Because all files and strings used in the testing code will be stored externally, these test executables will execute the test code and demonstrate that all tests are validated.
</p>

<p>Below is the process that will be followed for each test</p>
<ul>
<li>The milestone source code zip file will be exploded and set up on the Test Server</li>
<li>The submission src/csharp/test/[application section] directory will be copied to the application directory of the application</li>
<li>The NAnt compile task will be called to build the test assemblies.</li>
<li>The NAnt test command will be called to execute the tests.</li>
</ul>

<div class="sectionHeader">How the submission Test Cases will be evaluated during review</div>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Delivery Screening</strong><br />Verify the following deliverables are included in the milestone.</li>

    <li><strong>Successful Execution of Application Build</strong><br />The submission will be scored on easily the reviewer is able to execute the build scripts to create and deploy the application</li>
    <li><strong>Successful Execution of Test Cases</strong><br />The submission will be scored on the successful execution of the test cases defined for this milestone.</li>
    <li><strong>Completeness of test case implementations</strong><br />The review will evaluate whether the minimum number of test cases where implemented</li>
    <li><strong>Accuracy of test case implementations</strong><br />The review will evaluate whether the test cases where implemented to correctly test the requirements of the application</li>
    <li><strong>Thoroughness of test cases to application requirements</strong><br />If the submission includes additional test cases, this will evaluate how well the test cases meet the edge cases for the application</li>
