<tr><td class="dark"><span class="bigRed">BB_Stuart</span></td><td class="dark"><span class="bigRed">Within Fixed Income you have basic bonds, Swaps, Credit derivatives and Mortgages. You also have Currencies and Commodities</span></td></tr>

<tr><td class="dark"><span class="bigRed">BB_Stuart</span></td><td class="dark"><span class="bigRed">S_A_R_O_J: no, MTGE is different. It is more like this. WHen someone gets a mtge on a condo or a house or a co-op, the bank does not keep the MTGE anymore</span></td></tr>
