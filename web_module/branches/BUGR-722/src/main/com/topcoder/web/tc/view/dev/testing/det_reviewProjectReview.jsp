<span class="bigTitle">Online Review Project Review Tests Competition</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The Online Review and Scorecard Project will enhance TopCoder's current online review and scorecard systems to streamline and simplify the review process.
<br><br>
The redesigned Online Review and Scorecards will be more flexible and provide better insight into TopCoder's application process.  The current system automates the TopCoder Software peer review process only for Component Designs and Component Developments. The new infrastructure will allow for more project types (i.e. Application Specification, Application Architecture), multiple scorecards per project (i.e. FDA, SOX, SEC), optional review phases (i.e. submission) and custom review phases (i.e. client review). The creation of "on demand" review will allow projects to advance to the next phase as soon as the review is complete, rather than waiting for a deadline to pass or manual advancement by administrators.
<br><br>
The application should provide easy access to detailed information on each project phase, as well as offering users the ability to view only the projects with which they are associated. This will allow PMs, clients and architects to view project status and timelines for all project types.
<br><br>
The Online Review Application will also automate the TopCoder Software peer review process for both Component Design and Component Development competitions.  Reviewers must be able to log in, check the status of their assignments, download submissions for review, complete online review forms, and perform aggregation of reviews.  Administrators should have special rights, with the ability to set up reviews, assign members, monitor the process, and intervene at any stage of development.
<br><br>
Although the application will be initially used by TopCoder, it should be built so that it is generic enough for any organization to use.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
This assembly competition will consist of performing screening, reviews, appeals, appeals response, aggregation, aggregation review, final review and approval. This project will also consist of viewing screenings, reviews, appeals, appeals response, aggregation, aggregation review, final reviews, approval and composite reviews.
