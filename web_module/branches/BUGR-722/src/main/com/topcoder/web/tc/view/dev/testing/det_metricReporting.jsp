<span class="bigTitle">Metric Reporting Testing Competition - Manage Metric Group</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The Metric Reporting System provides an online reporting tool that will allow users to analyze a dynamic set of data using both static and dynamic graphs.  Users will be able to generate graphs based on this data and apply filtering options to the data to focus the reports on specific subsets of data.  In addition, the system will allow users to drag-n-drop pre-generated graphs from a master list to create a customized home page.
<br><br>
The Metric Reporting System is composed of a series of components built through the TopCoder Component Production methodology. Additionally, a set of components has been developed to utilize the ILOG Charts SDK.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
The application described above has already been created.  The goal of this competition is to try and break it.  The competitors in this competition will create a set of automated test cases that will verify that the application is implemented according to the requirements documentation. The application has been divided into small, logical sections.  This competition represents the test cases for one section of this application. For section, a minimum set of test scenarios has already been created.  It is recommended that additional tests are also created.
