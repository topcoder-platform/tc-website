<span class="bigTitle">Warehouse Management Phase 2 Reporting</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The Warehouse Management System will significantly increase productivity, cut costs and drastically improve productivity by providing real time, on-demand reports.
<br><br>
The reports will be written in MS SQL Server/Report Server and will provide the client with powerful information that they are currently missing. These reports will serve two basic functions:
<ul>
<li>First, these reports will be used for almost every aspect of the company, including sales, accounting, planning, allocating, and logistics.</li>
<li>Second, these reports will include transaction summary reports. These will be used as an audit trail to track items and to measure efficiency.</li>
</ul>
Each report will consist of a filter screen and a report displaying the appropriate information.  Drop down lists on the filter screens are driven from the tables specific to the given reports attributes. These reports provide management timely and accurate data for all business activities throughout the day, month and year.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
The Reporting Assembly Competition is a straightforward, logical, and a manageable project.  This competition is a great opportunity for a developer to gain exposure to report server, or for an experienced report writer to shine.  Once these reports have been completed they will revolutionize the way that our client does business.
<br><br>
The reports will summarize all the activities that will be accomplished in phase 2 along with any corresponding exceptions.  Specifically these reports will summarize items being purchased via purchase orders, items being received & audited, unprocessed goods, and processed goods.  These reports will be used by sales to know what goods they have available, by management to grade their teams performance, and to schedule future work.  The exception reports will be used to catch mistakes, so that users can be educated.
