<span class="bigTitle">UML Tool Backend Assembly</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span>
<br><br>
The UML Tool Backend Data Model is one part of the TopCoder UML Tool, which will be used by component competition competitors, as well as TopCoder staff to design and review components.
<br><br>
This assembly competition covers the data model of the tool.  No GUI elements will be developed as part of this particular assembly competition. 
<br><br>
The following functionality is covered:
<ul>
<li>Data model classes, used to represent different elements in a design</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Use case classes</li>
    <li>Sequence diagram classes</li>
    <li>Activity diagram classes</li>
    <li>Class diagram classes</li>
    </ul>
<li>XMI import and export, used for saving and opening files</li>
<li>Data model actions (undo / redo)</li>
</ul>
Most of the functionality is already covered by components. The assembly teams will be required to merge all the components together and write comprehensive unit tests for the data model. Any bugs in the components will also need to be fixed and documented. It is important for the UML Tool to have a solid and stable data model.
<br><br>
The assembled back end will be used by the assemblers of the final GUI application.
<br><br>
NOTE: Please see eligibility requirements below. Competitors must sign a non-disclosure agreement before being admitted into this competition. If you have already submitted a non-disclosure agreement for another assembly competition you are not required to submit another one.
