                    <p>TopCoder high school students, get ready!</p>
                    <p>Announcing the 2010 TopCoder High School Tournament! TopCoder is excited to bring back this premier programming tournament for high school-aged math and science students enrolled in secondary schools or equivalent programs world-wide.</p>
              <p>Given the competitive technological nature of today's world, we believe it is more important than ever to encourage, reward and recognize those who possess the skills to shape tomorrow's surroundings. By having a tournament for high school-aged students, TopCoder is doing its part to ensure that there is a fun and competitive learning environment where students from around the world can build and showcase their talent.</p>
                <p><span class="subtitle">Overview</span>
                	<br />
           	  TopCoder is currently holding bimonthly challenges, called Single Round Matches (SRMs), which are available for all TopCoder members who are high school students. The SRMs will allow students to demonstrate their problem-solving skills by unraveling complex word problems through the use of a computer language - either Java, C++, C# or VB.Net. They are also a great avenue for practicing for the tournament.&nbsp; Additionally there are a number of practice rooms and practice problems available in the Competition Arena.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>The worldwide TopCoder High School tournament will begin in February 27, 2010, and will finalize online in March.&nbsp; The tournament will consists of three online elimination rounds as well as one online Championship Round, all in the SRM format.
