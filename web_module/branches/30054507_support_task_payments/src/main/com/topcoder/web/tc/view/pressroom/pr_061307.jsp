<p>The TopCoder community will compete in a Wikipedia analysis challenge which will aid Professor Lakhani's research on distributed innovation systems and the movement of innovative activity to the edges of organizations and into communities (see <a href="<tc-webtag:linkTracking link='http://courseware.hbs.edu/public/cases/wikipedia/' refer='pr_061307' />">http://courseware.hbs.edu/public/cases/wikipedia/</a> for more details on the project).</p>

<p>Lakhani is a professor at the Harvard Business School where he does research on distributed innovation systems and the movement of innovative activity to the edges of organizations and into communities. He has extensively studied the emergence of open source software communities and their unique innovation and product development strategies.</p>
