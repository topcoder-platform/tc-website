/**
 * <p>The remote interface of the ComponentManager Enterprise Java Bean (EJB).
 * ComponentManagerEJB and CatalogEJB constitute the Component Catalog of the
 * Distributed Development Environment. ComponentManagerEJB contains the methods
 * that a client can use to query and modify the properties of individual
 * components and their versions.</p>
 *
 * <p>ComponentManagerEJB is a stateful session bean and supports the concept of
 * an Active Version. The Active version must not be confused with the Current
 * version of a component, which refers to the latest completed version (or the
 * first version if no versions have been completed), or the Latest version,
 * which refers to the version with the highest version number (which
 * may still be in collaboration, specification, or development). The active
 * version refers to the state of an instance of ComponentManager, and can also
 * be thought of as the "selected" version. Each instance of ComponentManager
 * can only be used to work with a single version (the active version) of a
 * single component at a time. The component and active version are specified
 * when the instance is created, but the active version can be changed by
 * calling the <code>setVersion</code> method. To work with a different
 * component, a separate instance of ComponentManager must be created.</p>
