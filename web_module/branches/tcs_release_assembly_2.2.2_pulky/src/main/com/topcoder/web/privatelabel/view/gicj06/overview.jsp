<br><br>
Get ready! Google is on its way to India again and they are looking for the best. Don't miss out on Google Code Jam India. This exciting contest gives you the chance to show off your coding talent for Rs. 1,500,000 in cash and prizes!
<br><br>
<span class="greenSubtitle">The Competition:</span>
<br><br>
The tournament is a timed contest where all participants compete online to solve the same problems under the same time
constraints.
<br><br>
The competition is available in two programming languages - Java and C++.
<br><br>
A wizard with C but rusty with C++? Don't worry! We've got it covered. Check out the <A href="/pl/?module=Static&d1=gicj06&d2=cpp">C++ for C Programmers page</A> that shows you the basics of learning C++ for the competition. Also, be sure to spend time in the Practice Rooms by clicking on the Competition Arena link above.
<br><br>
Here's the line-by-line documentation:
<br><br>

<div class="indented">
    <b>Download the Arena</b><br>
    The TopCoder&#174; Competition Arena (a Java Applet) is where you begin. Download the app, read the problem
    statements, then code solutions, compile and test those solutions and submit the code for points. You can download
    the arena ahead of time to practice on sample problems prior to the competition.
    <br><br>
    <b>Coding Phase</b><br>
    At the designated date and time, competitors enter the Arena and are placed in groups of ten into virtual rooms. All
    participants are presented with the same set of three problems of escalating difficulty. In a race to see who can
    create an accurate solution in the shortest amount of time, competitors try to out-think and out-code their
    opponents. The Leader Board tallies the points during each step of the competition.
    <br><br>
    <b>Challenge Phase</b><br>
    During the Challenge Phase, competitors view each other's code and try to "break'" that code by passing test cases
    through the submitted code, with the hope that the results are not satisfied by the software written. Breaking
    another developer's code is the most direct form of competition for a programmer. In this phase, points are awarded
    for successful challenges and deducted for unsuccessful challenges.
    <br><br>
    <b>System Tests</b><br>
    Within minutes of the end of the Challenge Phase, the automated, objective system tests determine the accuracy of
    all submissions and award final points to all competitors. The assessment of your performance and presentation of
    stats is nearly instantaneous, as is the gratification of knowing how you did against a competitive field.
