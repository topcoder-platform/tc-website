               <p class ="regmiddle">Sun Microsystems has again teamed up with TopCoder to bring the JavaOne<sup>SM</sup> Coding Challenge to conference attendees.
               This unique event gathers together developers who use Java&#153; technology for coding, competition, and fun. By participating
               in the JavaOne Coding Challenge, attendees have the opportunity to apply what they learn during the Conference sessions
               to real-world programming problems that have a Mobility, Enterprise Applications, or Service-oriented architectures theme. If you are a
               Java technology developer, you do not want to miss this event. The first 800 participants will receive a JavaOne Coding
               Challenge, Powered by TopCoder messenger bag and t-shirt</p>

               <p class ="regmiddle"><strong><font size="4">Let the Coding Begin!</font></strong><br/></p>
               <p class ="regmiddle">Each day offers a qualification round - a 30-minute challenge pitting you against all other participants from the JavaOne Conference.</p>

               <p class ="regmiddle">In the onsite Competition Arena, participants will be presented with real-world programming problems and will be
               given 30 minutes to use the Java programming language to code, compile, test, and submit solutions to the problem sets.
               The problems will focus on the 3 major themes for the 2005 JavaOne Conference - Mobility, Enterprise Applications, Service-oriented architectures.</p>

               <p class ="regmiddle">After each day's qualification round, TopCoder will objectively score the competitors' submissions for accuracy and for length of time to
               complete the problem. The four individuals with the highest scores
               will be invited back in the evening to compete head-to-head in the Competition Arena, where they will battle it out for
               that day's grand prize.</p>

               <p class ="regmiddle"><strong><font size="4">Be Recognized</font></strong></p>

               <p class ="regmiddle">Have you ever wanted to show your colleagues how much better you are in your Java programming skills? This is the
               way to show off your stuff. Take your grand prize back to the office and show your peers that you came out on top!
               The winners of each day's competition will be recognized by posting their name on the Coding Challenge Scoreboard and on the JavaOne website.</p>
