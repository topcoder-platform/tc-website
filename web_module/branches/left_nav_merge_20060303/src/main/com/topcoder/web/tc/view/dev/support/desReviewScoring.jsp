            <p class="bodyText"><h2 align="left">Design Review Scoring</h2></p>

            <p class="bodyText">
            The intent of TopCoder's Review Scoring system is to allow for competitors to exceed the requirements as detailed in the requirements specification.  To achieve this, certain questions should be scored on a "3-based" scale.  This means that the competitor should be given a score of 3 if they meet the requirements.  The competitor would be given a 4 only if they exceed the requirements for a particular question.  In contrast, a "4-based" scoring system means that the competitor would be given a 4 unless there is a flaw.
            </p>

            <p class="bodyText">There are at least 2 flaws with a 4-based system that the 3-based system attempts to solve.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>We would like to encourage competitors to do excellent work.  In other words, we would like competitors to exceed the requirements.  With a 3-based system, we can do that by allowing a competitor to achieve a higher score if they do an exceptional job.</li>
            <li>Anything less than the meeting the requirements should not be rewarded.  Requirements should be considered the lower limit in quality.  Software that does not meet its requirements is not something TopCoder should be selling.  Accepting it is likely to cost us more than not.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="bodyText">
            Not all questions leave room for a competitor to excel on.  Below is a list of those questions where the developer should receive a 4 when the requirement is met (4-based scoring).  All other questions should be scored such that if the requirements are simply met, the competitor gets a 3; if the requirements are exceeded, then the competitor may be given a 4.
            </p>
            <p class="bodyText">
            For 3-based questions, the reviewer must include comments when giving a question a score of 1, 2 and 4.  1 and 2 should be obvious, the comments should indicate what is wrong.  For a score of 4 the comment should explain what the competitor did to exceed the requirements.  For a score of 3, the reviewer is not required to make significant comments other than "yes" or "ok", but an appropriate comment would be to indicate what the competitor could have done to achieve a 4.
