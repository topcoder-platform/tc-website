            The TopCoder Collegiate Challenge is void in the Quebec province of Canada, and elsewhere where prohibited by applicable law. Cash prizes will not be paid to residents of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria.
            </p>
            <p>
            Those members who are eligible to compete in both the Algorithm Competition and in the CDDC will be permitted to participate in both.  In addition, members will be allowed to compete in both the design and development competitions of the CDDC.  However, if one member participates in Online Rounds #1 and #2 of both the design and development competitions AND qualifies as one of the finalists in each, then the member will be permitted to advance to the final round of only one of the competitions.  The following criteria will be used to determine which competition the member will advance to:
            </p>

            <ul>
            <li>The member will advance to the competition in which he/she achieved a higher cumulative score. (Details of how the cumulative score is calculated are provided below.)</li>
            <li>If the member's cumulative score is the same in both competitions, then the member will advance to the competition in which he/she achieved a higher individual component score in Online Round #2.</li>
            <li>If the member's Online Round #2 individual component score is the same for both competitions, then the member will choose the final round in which he/she will compete.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Employees of TopCoder, Inc. and those involved in the production (including prize suppliers), implementation and distribution of this tournament and their advertising or promotion agencies, parent companies, service providers, agents, officers, subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other persons or entities directly associated with the tournament and members of the immediate families and/or persons living in the same household as such persons, are ineligible to enter the tournament.

 <!-- Competition Structure -->
            <a name="structure"></a>
            <h2><a href="#top"><img src="/i/tournament/tccc04/back_to_top.gif" alt="back to top" width="83" height="23" border="0" align="right">
            </a>Competition Structure</h2>

            <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Scoring</span><br/>
            During each online round of competition, eligible competitors will submit design and development solutions for at least one eligible component by the submission due date.  Submissions will be scored by the TopCoder Review Boards and will be subject to final review and appeal in the same manner as standard component design and development submissions.</p>

            <p>ALL SUBMISSIONS MUST BE RECEIVED DURING THE ROUND'S SUBMISSION TIMELINE TO BE CONSIDERED A VIABLE ENTRY.  THERE WILL BE NO EXCEPTIONS.  There will be no elimination of contestants between Online Rounds #1 and #2.  All contestants who submit components that pass screening in Online Round #1 in either competition will be eligible to participate in Online Round #2 of the same competition. The specific structure of the online rounds is as follows:</p>

            <ul>
            <li><b>Online Round #1</b><br/>
            All eligible members may compete in Online Round #1 of either or both competition(s).  Those contestants who submit components that pass screening will be eligible to compete in Online Round #2.</li>

            <li><b>Online Round #2</b><br/>
            All contestants who submitted components that passed screening in Online Round #1 will compete and the four (4) contestants in each competition with the highest cumulative scores will advance to the Onsite Championship Round #3.  The Online Round #2 component score will be weighted more heavily than the Online Round #1 component score in calculating the cumulative score. Each contestant's cumulative score will be calculated as follows:<br/><br/>
               <ul>
               <li>Cumulative score = Highest individual component score from Online Round #1 + (Highest individual component score from Online Round #2 x 1.3)</li>
            </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
            Note:  In the event of a tie in Round #2, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order):
              </li>
              <li>
              <ul>
              <li>
                   By the highest individual Online Round #2 submission score
              </li>
              <li>
                   If a tie still remains, the earliest submitter for the Online Round #2 contest will advance
              </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Onsite Championship Round #3</span><br/>
             Four (4) members will compete in each competition.  The member with the highest individual component score in Round #3 will be declared the winner.</p>
             <p>
             The four (4) advancers from Online Round #2 in each competition will travel to the Boston Park Plaza Hotel & Towers on Thursday, April 15 to compete in the final review stage of Round #3 being held on Friday, April 16.  All contestants must arrive at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel & Towers no later than 4:00 PM on Thursday, April 15.  If a contestant is unable to attend the onsite round, he/she will forfeit his/her eligibility to receive a prize, and his/her spot in the tournament will be given to the next highest cumulative scorer.  All 8 advancing competitors will be required to confirm their ability to travel to and attend the onsite rounds by <b>6:00PM EST on Wednesday, March 24</b>.</p>
             <p>
             TopCoder will provide travel arrangements for each competitor up to a cost of $1,000 per person.  (That is, if a contestant's airfare is greater than $1,000, the contestant will be responsible for the difference between the cost of the airfare and $1,000.)  The Boston Park Plaza Hotel & Towers will provide travel arrangements to and from the airport, and TopCoder will provide accomodations and certain meals for each contestant.  All other expenses are the responsibility of the contestant.  TopCoder will <b>not</b> provide travel or lodging accommodations for competitor guests at the 2004 TCCC.</p>
             <p>
             Championship Round #3 will be a single round of four (4) members in each competition.  Two winners will be crowned, one Design Champion and one Development Champion.  Each champion will be the member with the highest score of his/her component submission in each competition.</p>

            <p>Championship Tiebreaker:  In the event of a tie in the Championship Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order):</p>

            <ol>
            <li>By cumulative score at the end of Online Round #2 (highest cumulative score wins)</li>
            <li>If a tie still remains, then by the highest Online Round #2 submission score</li>
            <li>If a tie still remains, then the prize money will be distributed equally among the tied members</li>
            </ol>

         <p>All decisions relating to the viability of submissions, the ranking of submissions and all other matters pertaining to the tournament shall be within the sole discretion of TopCoder or its designee and shall be final and binding in all respects.</p>
