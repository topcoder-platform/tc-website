<span class="bigTitle">TopCoder C++ for C Programmers</span>

<br><br>
C++ is an object oriented extension to the C programming language. C++ provides many benefits over traditional C while
still maintaining C compatibility, allowing people to use C and C++ program in the same program. Within a competition,
you'll be required to use some basic C++ functionality to sovle problems. What follows is a basic explanation for
programmers who are currently familiar with C.
<br><br>
<span class="greenSubtitle">Classes and Methods</span><br>
The most important new feature in C++ is the addition of classes. A class is a structure that contains methods as well
as variables. During a competition, you'll need to write one class containing (at least) one method. For example, take
the following problem definition:
<br><br>
Class: CellTower<br>
Method: best<br>
Parameters: vector &lt;string&gt;, int, int<br>
Returns: int<br>
Method signature: int best(vector &lt;string&gt; towers, int x, int y)<br>
<br><br>
To solve the problem you'll need to create a class named <strong>CellTower</strong> containing a method <strong>
    best</strong> that takes three arguements (<strong>vector&lt;string&gt;</strong>, <strong>int</strong>, and <strong>
    int</strong>), and returns an <strong>int</strong>.
<br><br>
Classes are defined using the <strong>class</strong> keyword. The definition follows a similar pattern as the C <strong>
    struct</strong> keyword. To define the class above we'd use the following code:
<pre>
    class CellTower {
    public:
    int best(vector&lt;string&gt; towers, int x, int y) {
    //your code here
    }
    };
</pre>
Note how the method is defined like you would define a standard C function. The <strong>public</strong> keyword tells
the compiler that the method we're defining is accessable to any object, allowing the testing process to properly
execute your code.
<br><br>
<span class="greenSubtitle">The STL</span><br>
Many of the classes and functions used in competition come from the Standard Type Library, also known as the STL. The
STL provides a set of common libraries to perform everything from basic string work to complicated sorting algorithms.
<br><br>
To be able to compete, you'll need to be familiar with two classes: <strong>vector</strong> and <strong>string</strong>.
<br><br>
<span class="greenSubtitle">Includes</span><br>
Before you can use any of the STL classes, you'll need to include the appropriate header files. The <strong>
    vector</strong> class comes from the header "vector" and the <strong>string</strong> class comes from the header
"string". In addition, you'll need to add the line <pre>using namespace std;</pre> to your code to tell the compiler to
look for objects in the std namespace.
<br><br>
<span class="greenSubtitle">Vector</span><br>
A <strong>vector</strong> is the C++ replacement for arrays. Vectors solve many of the problems of tradidional C arrays
by allowing dynamic resizing and providing methods to inspect the current size of the array. You declare a vector as
<strong>vector&lt;type&gt;</strong> where type is the type of variable stored in the array. To create a vector of
<strong>ints</strong>, you'd write <pre>vector&lt;int&gt; myVar;</pre>Newly created <strong>vectors</strong> are of size
0. To declare a <strong>vector</strong> with a specific size, you can use <pre>vector&lt;int&gt; myVar(10);</pre>In this
case the newly created <strong>vector</strong> has a size of 10.
<br><br>
To set / retrieve the elements in a <strong>vector</strong>, you can use the same syntax you'd use to work with a C
array.

<pre>
    vector&lt;int&gt; myVar(10);

    myVar[0] = 1; //sets the first element to 1
    printf("%i", myVar[0]); //prints 1
</pre>

One of the major problems with C arrays is that there is no way at runtime to know how large the array is, making
looping over the contents of the array difficult. Using <strong>vectors</strong>, this task becomes simple. The <strong>
    size()</strong> method will return the current size of the <strong>vector</strong>.

<pre>
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; myVar.size(); i++) {
    printf("%i", myVar[i]); //prints element i
    }
</pre>

To resize a <strong>vector</strong>, use the <strong>resize</strong> method.

<pre>
    myVar.resize(15); //sets the size of myVar to 15
</pre>

The <strong>vector</strong> class contains many additional useful functions, which you can read more about by following
the reference links below.

<br><br>

<span class="greenSubtitle">String</span><br>
The <strong>string</strong> class is designed to replace using the <strong>char*</strong> type to represent text.
<strong>Strings</strong> allow for basic manipulation, and provides the ability to use the string class in functions
that require a <strong>char*</strong>. To assign values to a string, you can use the = and + operators.

<pre>
    string s;
    s = "Hello";
    s = s + ", world";
</pre>
The <strong>string</strong> s is initially created as an empty string (a string of size zero), is assigned the value
"Hello", then has ", world" appended to the end of the string. The <strong>string</strong> s now contains "Hello,
world".
<br><br>

The method <strong>size()</strong> will return the length of the <strong>string</strong>. The code
<pre>
    string s = "Hello";
    printf("%i", s.size());
</pre>

will output 5.
<br><br>
You can access specific characters in the <strong>string</strong> by using the object as if it were a <strong>
    char</strong> array.

<pre>
    string s = "Hello";
    printf("%c", s[0]); //outputs "H"
    s[0] = 'h'; //string is now "hello"
</pre>
To use the string in a function that expects a <strong>char*</strong>, use the <strong>c_str()</strong> method.
<pre>
    string s = "Hello";
    printf("%s", s.c_str()); //outputs "Hello"
</pre>

<span class="greenSubtitle">Example Submission</span><br>
Consider the following sample problem:
<br><br>
Our input program has recorded keyboard input into an array of characters. We want to convert the input sequence to a
single string for further processing. Make a method <strong>buildString</strong> that takes a <strong>
    vector&lt;char&gt;</strong> representing the keyboard input and returns a concatenated <strong>string</strong>.
<br><br>
Class: StringBuilder<br>
Method: buildString<br>
Parameters: vector &lt;char&gt;<br>
Returns: string<br>
Method signature: string buildString(vector &lt;char&gt; array)
<br><br>
The following submission would use the <strong>string</strong> and <strong>vector</strong> classes to solve the problem:

<pre>
    #include&lt;vector&gt;
    #include&lt;string&gt;

    using namespace std;

    class StringBuilder {
    public:
    string buildString(vector&lt;char&gt; array) {
    //create string for return value
    string s;

    //loop over every element in the array
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; array.size(); i++) {
    s = s + array[i];
    }

    //return the created string
    return s;
    }
    };
</pre>
