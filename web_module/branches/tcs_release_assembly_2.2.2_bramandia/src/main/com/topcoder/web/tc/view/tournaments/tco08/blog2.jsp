            <p>Posted May 14th 2008 10:55PM by <tc-webtag:handle coderId="14999860" darkBG="true" /></p>
            <p>This morning started with a cricket running loose in the arena. We luckily captured him and were able to let him loose back into the out doors.</p>
            <p>Since then, the day has been pretty laid back. The Studio finals were a lot of fun today and all the competitors had some really cool projects. Lilly was really impressed with the outcome. We just finished up going over the awards ceremony and we're all hoping it runs nice and smooth tomorrow. We have one last day in Vegas. I can't believe how fast the event has gone already.</p>
            <p>Right now the poker tournament is in full swing and everyone is enjoying hot fudge sundaes. Yummy! I'm going back to the junk food now.</p>

            <p>Posted May 13th 2008 10:01PM by <tc-webtag:handle coderId="14999860" darkBG="true" /></p>
            <p>This very long day is almost over. We are on the last round of the day, the wildcard. It was great to have dinner tonight before the round with <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="309453" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="251074" darkBG="true" />. They are all competing against each other but a few hours ago it was all fun and laughter over dinner.</p>
            <p>My funny tidbits of the day:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a ladder puzzle at the VeriSign booth and I sat down with <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10348862" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="278342" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="297731" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="13298470" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="252022" darkBG="true" /> and we all were trying to do this puzzle. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10348862" darkBG="true" /> could do it but I'm pretty sure he cheated. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="278342" darkBG="true" /> figured it out but had no idea how. We basically were sitting on the floor for 30 minutes cursing over this stupid puzzle that we were convinced was impossible. It was funny.</li>
                <li>At dinner, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="262056" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="15545604" darkBG="true" /> were telling us about their magic carpet ride from TCO06. I had no idea what they were talking about but they showed me the video. We were all in hysterics! Enjoy: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbMeIXYJiJU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbMeIXYJiJU</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is nothing funnier about my day than seeing <tc-webtag:handle coderId="262056" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="15545604" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" darkBG="true" /> and company on this video swinging their shirts around. Hysterical!</p>
            <br />
            
            <h3>Nerves before the Wildcard...</h3>
            <p>Posted May 13th 2008 9:01PM by <tc-webtag:handle coderId="282560" darkBG="true" /></p>
            <p>It has been an exciting Tuesday. We finished Round 3 of the Semifinals about an hour ago. Nine of the competitors for the Finals have been picked; from Round 3 we had <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11829284" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7459080" darkBG="true" />, and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="269554" darkBG="true" />. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="269554" darkBG="true" /> hasn't advanced to the TCO finals since '03; <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11829284" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7459080" darkBG="true" /> haven't faced each other in a final round since TCCC in '06 (only 50 points separated them). Many of the competitors have compared the Wildcard to torture, since there is only one advancer out of twelve and it is so late at night. Keep in mind they haven't seen the problems yet.</p>
            <p>At the dinner before the match, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="309453" darkBG="true" /> were joking about being in the wildcard together. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" darkBG="true" /> is no stranger to the event, having <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">won</span> advanced from the wildcard last year, advancing to the last round, only to see his 500 fall giving <tc-webtag:handle coderId="309453" darkBG="true" /> the win. It'll be interesting to see who comes out on top this year. The round is really strong; having many competitors who are seasoned in these events, and several rematches. It'll definitely be a nail-biter.</p>
            <p>Edit: Apologies to <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7446789" darkBG="true" /> who actually did win the wildcard last year, not <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" darkBG="true" />!</p>

            <p>The last Semifinal of this year's TCO turned out to have more complicated problems than two previous ones. However submissions on Easy didn't reflect it. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="251074" darkBG="true" /> was the first to submit the 250-pointer for 237.69 points. He was just 3 points in front of <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11919691" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7459080" darkBG="true" />. Many more coders also submitted the Easy very fast. After that there was a very long silent period of time. Most coders went to the 550-pointer, but some tried the 950-pointer first. The idea of solution for the 550-pointer was not hard, but it required lengthy and careful implementation. To the contrary, 950-pointer required really small implementation, but the idea was hard to get.</p>

            <p>Let's start with a couple of pictures from semi-final 1 (I didn't have my USB cable last post!):</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco08/blogPics/image115.jpg" alt="image115.jpg" style="width:250px; height:190px; border:#ffffff 1px solid;" /><br /><em><tc-webtag:handle coderId="270505" darkBG="true" /> competes in sunglasses...</em></p>

            <p>As I type this the 3rd and last semi-final has just completed. After sitting at the top, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="251074" darkBG="true" /> dropped into a wildcard slot alongside fellow target <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" darkBG="true" /> (who was lucky to advance with just his 250 in the last minutes of semi-final 1). This seemed the toughest problem set so far, with many failed mediums and no hard poblems submitted at all. After a fairly eventful challenge phase, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11829284" darkBG="true" /> ended as room winner, followed by <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7459080" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="269554" darkBG="true" />.</p>
            <p>After a bunch of problems earlier with the real-time scoreboard, TC announced a new, working version! So this time, the systest results could be displayed in the traditional way, instead of the winners being announced through the PA system!</p>

            <p>The Algorithm Competition of TCO'08 continued with Semifinal Room 2. The actions started early as <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8355516" context="algorithm" darkBG="true" /> submitted the Easy for 243,28 points. Many other competitors followed closely behind. Some time later <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8355516" context="algorithm" darkBG="true" /> found a bug in his code and resubmitted to let the lead to <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10574855" context="algorithm" darkBG="true" />, who quickly made his lead stronger by fast 500 submission. Poles <tc-webtag:handle coderId="14886245" context="algorithm" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8355516" context="algorithm" darkBG="true" /> had also quite good times on the Medium soon after <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10574855" context="algorithm" darkBG="true" />. But the following 15 minutes without submission on 500 showed that the Medium problem was not very easy. Still, it was not very hard, too, so more submissions on it were made and we saw 12 submissions by the end of coding phase.</p>

            <p>Algorithm Semifinal 1 opened the TCO'08 Algorithm Competition this morning. The round proved to be quite eventful. It started from many fast submissions on the 250, which was quite straightforward implementational problem. After this, nothing happened for a while. Most coders proceeded to the 500, but some skipped it to directly proceed to the 1000. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" context="algorithm" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="22652597" context="algorithm" darkBG="true" /> even started the round with the 1000.</p>
