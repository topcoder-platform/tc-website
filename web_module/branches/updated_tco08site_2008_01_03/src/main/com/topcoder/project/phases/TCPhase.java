/**
 * This class is used to provide extra functionality to the Phase class:
 * - Support for 0 length phases
 * - Support for construction using start and end date instead of start and length.
 * - Use minutes instead of hours.
 *
 * In order to use that class, the project must have an instance of TCWorkdays as its Workdays, because
 * this class has the needed method to substract dates.
 * VERY IMPORTANT:  if the Phase class is upgraded, please check that all the methods that use the
 * length variable or do a computation using hours are also upgraded here.
