            <p>Ribbit was created with the understanding that the next generation of great communication solutions would be created, not by us, and not by a traditional phone company&mdash;but by you, the Flash and Flex Developers. The Ribbit Voice Platform gives you, the most creative developers in the world, the ability to add rich communication features into your Flash and Flex projects by giving you direct access to the world's first global, programmable phone company. We're challenging you to help build the next generation phone company&mdash;by creating the next Ribbit Killer Application.</p>
            <h3>Everybody Wins!</h3>

            <h3>Benefits of Submitting Early - Prizes, Feedback and Your Own Studio Competition!</h3>
            <p>In addition to the prizes awarded to each checkpoint winner,  Ribbit &amp; TopCoder will provide feedback on these apps, in order for you to continue to improve and enhance your application. Taking the advice and guidance of the judging panel to further develop your submission into a Killer App, gives you a better chance to win a grand prize at the end of the competition.</p>
            <p>TopCoder will also award each checkpoint winner a $500 credit that can be used to run your own design competition (link to studio) on TopCoder Studio. Using this credit is entirely optional, but with it you can take advantage of the global design community of Studio to give your app a Killer UI!</p>
            <p>To be eligible for a checkpoint prize the application must have been submitted during the applicable phase of the contest. An application submitted in one phase can be eligible for prizes at additional checkpoints only if it has been resubmitted with notable changes, upgrades, improvements or enhancements as determined by the contest judges.</p>
