Subject line:  Pandemic Studios needs Game Developers and Designers</p>

<p>Dear [handle]:</p>

<p>Pandemic Studios has spent the past few years developing high-profile entertainment titles for some of the top 
publishers in the game industry, companies such as EA, Activision, and Lucas Arts. With each of these and several 
others, Pandemic has built a reputation as a dependable developer that is capable of producing high-quality work 
on all major platforms in genres as diverse as RTS, action, and sports.</p>

<p>Over the past 4-plus years, Pandemic Studios has steadily expanded its staff and production capability while 
keeping overhead and other costs to a minimum. Starting with a core of around a dozen people, Pandemic has 
expanded into a multi-title, multi-platform developer of nearly a hundred working on two continents. The company 
has succeeded by pouring the majority of its resources into building and maintaining a staff of the highest caliber 
programmers, artists, and designers.</p>

<p>If you're interesting in joining the Pandemic team, check out their
