<span class="title">How to Get Paid</span>
<br><br>
TopCoder begins the payment process for algorithm, design, development and assembly contests one business day after each contest is concluded.  Design, development, and assembly contests are over when they are closed and removed from the online review tool.  This will happen by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on the business day following the end of final review (for a successful project) or when all submissions have failed screening or review.
<br><br>
<strong>Timing</strong><br>
Payments of $25.00 or more are distributed on or before the 15th day of the following month. For example: payments earned between November 1 and November 30 will be sent out on or before December 15.
<br><br>
Payments will be issued on the following dates for 2007:

The only exceptions to this schedule are: 
<ul>
<li>Payments totaling less than $25.00. Payments will be held until the total balance that is owed you reaches or exceeds $25.00, at which point the normal payment process will begin. </li>
<li>When members request that TopCoder hold payments. You may prefer one larger payment to multiple smaller ones, for example, or you may want to ensure that a check doesn't come while you're out of town - if so, please e-mail payments@topcoder.com with your handle, full name, and the timing and/or dollar amount of your hold request.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Payment Methods</strong><br>
Members can be paid by check, by wire transfer, or by PayPal®. <A href="/tc?module=Static&d1=help&d2=paymentMethods&node=<%=node==null?"":node%>">Learn more</A>.
