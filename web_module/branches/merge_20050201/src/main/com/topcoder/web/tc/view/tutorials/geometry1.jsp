<span class="bodySubtitle">Introduction</span><br/>
Many TopCoders seem to be mortally afraid of geometry problems.  I think it's safe
to say that the majority of them would be in favor of a ban on TopCoder geometry
problems.  However, geometry is a very important part of most graphics programs,
especially computer games, and geometry problems are here to stay.  In this
article, I'll try to take a bit of the edge off of them, and introduce some
concepts that should make geometry problems a little less frightening.<br/>

<br/><a name="vectors"></a>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Vectors</span><br/>
Vectors are the basis of a lot of methods for solving geometry problems.  
Formally, a vector is defined by a direction and a
magnitude.  In the case of two-dimension geometry, a vector can be represented
as pair of numbers, x and y, which gives both a direction and a magnitude.  For
example, the line segment from (1,3) to (5,1) can be represented by the
vector (4,-2).  It's important to understand, however, that the vector defines
only the direction and magnitude of the segment in this case, and does not
define the starting or ending locations of the vector.<br/><br/>

<br/><a name="vector_addition"></a>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Vector Addition</span><br/>
There are a number of mathematical operations that can be performed on vectors.
The simplest of these is addition: you can add two vectors together and the
result is a new vector.  If you have two vectors <tt>(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)</tt>
and <tt>(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)</tt>, then the sum of the two vectors is simply
<tt>(x<sub>1</sub>+x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>+y<sub>2</sub>)</tt>.  The image 
below shows the sum of four vectors.  Note that it doesn't matter which order you
add them up in - just like regular addition.  Throughout these articles, we will
use plus and minus signs to denote vector addition and subtraction, where each is
simply the piecewise addition or subtraction of the components of the vector.
<div align=center><img src="/i/education/geometry01.png"/></div>

<br/><a name="dot_product"></a>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Dot Product</span><br/>
The addition of vectors is relatively intuitive; a couple of less obvious
vector operations are dot and cross products.  The dot product of two vectors is
simply the sum of the products of the corresponding elements.  For example, the
dot product of  <tt>(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)</tt> and <tt>(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)</tt>
is <tt>x<sub>1</sub>*x<sub>2</sub> + y<sub>1</sub>*y<sub>2</sub></tt>.  Note
that this is not a vector, but is simply a single number (called a scalar).  The
reason this is useful is that the dot product, <tt>A &sdot; B = |A||B|Cos(&theta;)</tt>, where
<tt>&theta;</tt> is the angle between the A and B.
<tt>|A|</tt> is called the norm of the vector, and in a 2-D geometry problem is
simply the length of the vector, <tt>sqrt(x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>)</tt>.
Therefore, we can calculate <tt>Cos(&theta;) = (A &sdot; B)/(|A||B|)</tt>.
By using the <tt>acos</tt> function, we can then find &theta;.  It is useful to
recall that <tt>Cos(90) = 0</tt> and <tt>Cos(0) = 1</tt>, as this tells you that a
dot product of 0 indicates two perpendicular lines, and that the dot product is
greatest when the lines are parallel.
A final note about dot products is that they are not limited to 2-D geometry.  We can take
dot products of vectors with any number of elements, and the above equality
still holds.
<div align=center><img src="/i/education/geometry02.png"/></div>

<br/><a name="cross_product"></a>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Cross Product</span><br/>
An even more useful operation is the cross product.  The cross product of two
2-D vectors is <tt>x<sub>1</sub>*y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>*x<sub>2</sub></tt>
Technically, the cross product is actually a vector, and has the magnitude given
above, and is directed in the +z direction.  Since we're only working with 2-D
geometry for now, we'll ignore this fact, and use it like a scalar.  Similar to
the dot product, <tt>A x B = |A||B|Sin(&theta;)</tt>.
However, &theta; has a slightly different meaning in this case:
<tt>|&theta;|</tt> is the angle between the two vectors, but &theta; is negative
or positive based on the right-hand rule. In 2-D geometry this means that if A
is less than 180 degrees clockwise from B, the value is positive.
Another useful fact related to the cross product is that the absolute value of 
<tt>|A||B|Sin(&theta;)</tt> is equal to the area of the
parallelogram with two of its sides formed by A and B.  Furthermore, the
triangle formed by A, B and the red line in the diagram has half of the area of
the parallelogram, so we can calculate its area from the cross product also.
<div align=center><img src="/i/education/geometry03.png"/></div>
<br/><a name="line_point_distance"></a>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Line-Point Distance</span><br/>
Finding the distance from a point to a line is something that comes up often in
geometry problems.  Lets say that you are given 3 points, A, B, and C, and you
want to find the distance from the point C to the line defined by A and B
(recall that a line extends infinitely in either direction).  The first step is
to find the two vectors from A to B (AB) and from A to C (AC).  Now, take the cross
product <tt>AB x AC</tt>, and divide by <tt>|AB|</tt>.
This gives you the distance (denoted by the red line) as <tt>(AB x AC)/|AB|</tt>.
The reason this works comes from some basic high school level geometry.  The
area of a triangle is found as <tt>base*height/2</tt>.  Now, the area of the
triangle formed by A, B and C is given by <tt>(AB x AC)/2</tt>.  The base of the
triangle is formed by AB, and the height of the triangle is the distance from
the line to C.  Therefore, what we have done is to find twice the area of the triangle
using the cross product, and then divided by the length of the base.  As always
with cross products, the value may be negative, in which case the distance is the
absolute value.
<div align=center><img src="/i/education/geometry04.png"/></div>
Things get a little bit trickier if we want to find the distance from a line
segment to a point.  In this case, the nearest point might be one of the
endpoints of the segment, rather than the closest point on the line.  In the
diagram above, for example, the closest point to C on the line defined by A and B is not on the
segment AB, so the point closest to C is B.
While there are a few different ways to check for this special case, one way is
to apply the dot product.  First, check to see if the nearest point on the line AB is
beyond B (as in the example above) by taking AB &sdot; BC.  If this value is
greater than 0, it means that the angle between AB and BC is between -90 and 90,
exclusive, and therefore the nearest point on the segment AB will be B.
Similarly, if BA &sdot; AC is greater than 0, the nearest point is A.  If both dot
products are negative, then the nearest point to C is somewhere along the
segment.  (There is another way to do this, which I'll discuss <a href="/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=geometry3#satellites">here</a>).
<pre class="code">
    <font color="blue">//Compute the dot product AB &sdot; BC</font>
    int dot(int[] A, int[] B, int[] C){
        AB = new int[2];
        BC = new int[2];
        AB[0] = B[0]-A[0];
        AB[1] = B[1]-A[1];
        BC[0] = C[0]-B[0];
        BC[1] = C[1]-B[1];
        int dot = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1];
        return dot;
    }
    <font color="blue">//Compute the cross product AB x AC</font>
    int cross(int[] A, int[] B, int[] C){
        AB = new int[2];
        AC = new int[2];
        AB[0] = B[0]-A[0];
        AB[1] = B[1]-A[1];
        AC[0] = C[0]-A[0];
        AC[1] = C[1]-A[1];
        int cross = AB[0] * AC[1] - AB[1] * AC[0];
        return cross;
    }
    <font color="blue">//Compute the distance from A to B</font>
    double distance(int[] A, int[] B){
        int d1 = A[0] - B[0];
        int d2 = A[1] - B[1];
        return sqrt(d1*d1+d2*d2);
    }
    <font color="blue">//Compute the distance from AB to C</font>
    <font color="blue">//if isSegment is true, AB is a segment, not a line.</font>
    double linePointDist(int[] A, int[] B, int[] C, boolean isSegment){
        double dist = cross(A,B,C) / distance(A,B);
        if(isSegment){
            int dot1 = dot(A,B,C);
            if(dot1 &gt; 0)return distance(B,C);
            int dot2 = dot(B,A,C);
            if(dot2 &gt; 0)return distance(A,C);
        }
        return abs(dist);
    }
</pre>
That probably seems like a lot of code, but lets see the same thing with a point
class and some operator overloading in C++ or C#.  The * operator is the dot product,
while ^ is cross product, while + and - do what you would expect.
<pre class="code">
    <font color="blue">//Compute the distance from AB to C</font>
    <font color="blue">//if isSegment is true, AB is a segment, not a line.</font>
    double linePointDist(point A, point B, point C, bool isSegment){
        double dist = ((B-A)^(C-A)) / sqrt((B-A)*(B-A));
        if(isSegment){
            int dot1 = (C-B)*(B-A);
            if(dot1 &gt; 0)return sqrt((B-C)*(B-C));
            int dot2 = (C-A)*(A-B);
            if(dot2 &gt; 0)return sqrt((A-C)*(A-C));
        }
        return abs(dist);
    }
</pre>
Operator overloading is beyond the scope of this article, but I suggest that you
look up how to do it if you are a C# or C++ coder, and write your own 2-D point class
with some handy operator overloading.  It will make a lot of geometry
problems a lot simpler.<br/>

<br/><a name="polygon_area"></a>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Polygon Area</span><br/>
Another common task is to find the area of a polygon, given the points around
its perimeter.  Consider the non-convex polygon below, with 5 points.  To
find its area we are going to start by triangulating it.  That is, we are going
to divide it up into a number of triangles.  In this polygon, the
triangles are ABC, ACD, and ADE.  But wait, you protest, not all of those
triangles are part of the polygon!  We are going to take advantage of the signed
area given by the cross product, which will make everything work out nicely.  First,
we'll take the cross product of <tt>AB x AC</tt> to find the area of ABC.  This will
give us a negative value, because of the way in which A, B and C are oriented.
However, we're still going to add this to our sum, as a negative number.
Similarly, we will take the cross product <tt>AC x AD</tt> to find the area of
triangle ACD, and we will again get a negative number.  Finally, we will take
the cross product <tt>AD x AE</tt> and since these three points are oriented in
the opposite direction, we will get a positive number.  Adding these three
numbers (two negatives and a positive) we will end up with a negative number, so
will take the absolute value, and that will be area of the polygon.
<div align=center><img src="/i/education/geometry05.png"/></div>
The reason this works is that the positive and negative number cancel each other
out by exactly the right amount.  The area of ABC and ACD ended up contributing
positively to the final area, while the area of ADE contributed negatively.
Looking at the original polygon, it is obvious that the area of the polygon is
the area of ABCD (which is the same as ABC + ABD) minus the area of ADE.  One
final note, if the total area we end up with is negative, it means that the
points in the polygon were given to us in clockwise order.  Now, just to make
this a little more concrete, lets write a little bit of code to find the area of
a polygon, given the coordinates as a 2-D array, p.
<pre class="code">
int area = 0;
int N = lengthof(p);
<font color="blue">//We will triangulate the polygon 
//into triangles with points p[0],p[i],p[i+1]</font>

for(int i = 1; i+1&lt;N; i++){
    int x1 = p[i][0] - p[0][0];
    int y1 = p[i][1] - p[0][1];
    int x2 = p[i+1][0] - p[0][0];
    int y2 = p[i+1][1] - p[0][1];
    int cross = x1*y2 - x2*y1;
    area += cross;
}
return abs(cross/2.0);
</pre>
Notice that if the coordinates are all integers, then the final area of the
polygon is one half of an integer.
