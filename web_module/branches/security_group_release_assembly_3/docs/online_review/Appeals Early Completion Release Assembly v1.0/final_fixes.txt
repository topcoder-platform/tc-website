Other work performed:

2) TCSDEVELOPER was updated in all deliverables
3) Hardcoded minimum screening pass score was fixed. 
    Please refer to http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=648125.
    You can easily test it by making a screening score 25 (score 1 in the single scorecard item) and run: (design scorecard)
    update scorecard set min_score = 26 where scorecard_id = 30000410;
    update scorecard set min_score = 10 where scorecard_id = 30000410;
    You'll see how the project details page react to this.

Thanks.
