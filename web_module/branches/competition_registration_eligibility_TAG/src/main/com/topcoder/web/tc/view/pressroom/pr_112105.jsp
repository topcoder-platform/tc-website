<p><strong>GLASTONBURY, CT, November 21, 2005 &#151;</strong>TopCoder&#174;, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, skills assessment and competitive software development, today announced that payments to winners of component design and development competitions in 2005 to date have yielded over $1,000,000 in prize earnings. TopCoder competitions have produced 340 new generic and 360 new custom .NET and Java components for the TopCoder Software catalogs. This represents an increase of more than 277 percent over payments made to members during the same period in 2004. In addition, TopCoder Software application projects have paid out a total of more than $430,000 to winners this year with all-time royalty payments passing the $53,000 mark. 
<br><br>
"The strength of TopCoder, simply put, is the TopCoder community - that's what makes us unique and successful," said Jack Hughes, Chairman and Founder of TopCoder, Inc. "Building and investing in that TopCoder asset base, meaning smart people, is what delivers superior results and ultimately drives down end-user cost." 
<br><br>
TopCoder is a worldwide community of programming excellence with more than 65,000 members representing 201 countries including China, the Russian Federation, Poland, Romania and the United States.
<br><br>
The current top three TopCoder design and development winners have average earning totals in excess of $52,000 in prize awards and more than $2,000 in royalty dividends to date. TopCoder component design and development competitions run 24 hours a day, seven days a week and allow participants a chance to gain recognition amongst the TopCoder community and learn about quality employment opportunities in addition to earning cash prizes.
<br><br>
"TopCoder's goal is to provide our customers with direct access to a professional community of talented developers in a highly competitive environment.  That community provides the means for members to show off their talents, learn from industry experts and improve their skills while earning cash," said Mike Morris, VP Software Development at TopCoder  "These payment numbers reflect an extremely positive trend in growth and the emergence of TopCoder as a viable alternative to traditional software outsourcing models."
<br><br>
TopCoder component competitions offer an attractive source of potential income that can provide a payout each quarter for as long as the component is offered in the TCS catalogs. Both collegiate and professional TopCoder members can earn cash payouts to subsidize college costs, augment their regular income or as a sole source of income.

<span class="bodySubtitle">TopCoder Member Royalties</span><br>
For members that work on component design and development projects royalties are distributed on a quarterly basis.  The Royalty Pool of money used for royalty distribution is calculated by taking a set percent of all generic component revenue.  Generic component revenue comes from the Generic Component Production portion of application projects.  Generic component revenue also comes from a percentage of all component catalog sales revenue.  The Royalty Pool is distributed based on the members' contribution to the catalogs. This contribution is calculated by taking all current components in the catalogs and determining the royalty split for contributors to the projects. For each component project the royalty distribution is split between the winning designer, design review board,, winning developer and development review board.
