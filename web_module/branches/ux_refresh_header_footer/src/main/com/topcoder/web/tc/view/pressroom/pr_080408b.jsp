<p>
<strong>GLASTONBURY, CT. &amp; SAN FRANCISCO, CA., August 4, 2008 &#151;</strong>TopCoder&reg;, Inc. and Think Services today announced the winner of the recent Software Architecture Challenge held during the Dr. Dobb's Architecture &amp; Design World 2008, July 21-24 at the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place in Chicago. Matt Cowan of Chicago won the first prize and Esteban Porcelli of Livingston, New Jersey took second place in the contest.
</p>

<p>
The Software Architecture Challenge presented attendees with a real-world exercise in architectural design to determine who could create and document the best comprehensive software solution to address a given set of system requirements within a set timeframe.
</p>

<p>
Cowan won an All Access pass to the Dr. Dobb's Event of his choice including SD Best Practices 2008, SD West 2009 or Dr. Dobb's Architecture &amp; Design World 2009, while Porcelli earned a 50% discount on the Dr. Dobb's Event of his choice.
</p>

<p>
"The Software Architecture Challenge provided an engaging and interactive experience for our attendees at Architecture &amp; Design World," said Amber Ankerholz, Conference Manager, Dr. Dobb's Events. "We would like to extend our congratulations to all of the attendees who participated."
</p>

<p>
During Architecture &amp; Design World attendees were asked to create submissions using the same scorecards and criteria that TopCoder uses to judge their own commercial software architecture competitions.
</p>

<p>
TopCoder tournaments are known worldwide as the most grueling, comprehensive test of skill in the field of competitive programming. The events allow competitors to solve complex algorithmic problems and design and develop working pieces of reusable software, and incorporate all current industry standard technologies, including Java, C++, C#, VB.NET, UML, J2EE and .NET.
</p>

<p>
"We saw very interesting submissions from our contestants, each of which used different technologies and different stylistic approaches to the problem -- from traditional stack builds to cloud type approaches using Google's App Engine," said Dave Messinger, Chief Architect of TopCoder. "The winning submission presented a very complete and elegant solution to the problem set."
