<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The Research Client application is one half of an application; the Research Project application. It's a Windows Forms application based on a Service Oriented Architecture. The entire Research Project application will allow users to perform searches on a database of Nielsen television ratings data by specifying complex search criteria. The results of these searchers are displayed to the user in the windows forms application on rich sortable grids. In addition, the application allows the user to save search criteria as a set, export search results to printer or email, and run pre-packaged standalone reports.  The Research Client will interact with the Research Server application. It will construct container objects representing search criteria, validate those criteria through a separate component, submit searches to the server, and render those results on its screens.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
The actual GUI screens have already been completed in the Research Screens component. The purpose of this assembly competition is to write code which interacts with those forms and relays information between them and the server layer. The competitors must develop code to interact with the WCF stubs from the server layer, construct the search objects, call the Research Validation component to validate user events, communicate validation errors to the user, bind results of server calls to the appropriate controls, and notify users of any server side errors that occur. In addition, the Research Client application must manage all interactions with the provided Application Host environment, including the addition of menus and listening for events. The Client application also handles the assignment of shortcut keys, and handles the events triggered by those shortcut keys.
