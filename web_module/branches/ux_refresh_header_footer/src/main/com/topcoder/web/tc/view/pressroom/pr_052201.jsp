<P CLASS="bodyTextBold">05.22.2001 - Sixteen Collegiate Programmers to Compete for Coveted "TopCoder" Title<BR/><SPAN CLASS="bodyTextItal">San Francisco Tournament Concurrent with Sun's JavaOne Event. Winners From Top Schools Will Share $250,000 in Prize Money</SPAN></P>
<P>Glastonbury, Conn. -- May 22, 2001 -- TopCoder Inc., a Glastonbury, Connecticut-based company committed to identifying and promoting top-notch computer programming talent, announced today the 16 finalists to compete in the upcoming TopCoder Collegiate Challenge being held June 5-7 at the San Francisco Hilton and Towers. The tournament also sets the stage for the official launch of TopCoder, which uses these competitions to attract and rate highly skilled programmers while acting as a conduit between its members and potential employers.</P>
<P>The finalists from across the U.S. are: Jon McAlister, Daniel Wright and David Pecora (Stanford University); Andrew Nierman, Jason Dillaman, and James Lee (University of Michigan,); Nathan Egge and Alex Kalita, (Virginia Polytechnic Institute); Benjamin Jackson and Sean Stanek, (Iowa State University); Jason Woolever (MIT); Kenneth Tang (University of California, San Diego); Jason Wodicka (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute); Aleksey Kurchuk (Rutgers University); Chad Wood (University of Texas at Austin); and Andrew Marut (Worcester Polytechnic Institute).</P>
<P>"Each year a new class of graduates enters the IT workforce," said TopCoder founder Jack Hughes. "TopCoder competitions help high-technology companies and recruiters identify and objectively assess candidates by testing and rating coding skills under real-world conditions."</P>
<P>Finalists advanced to the final rounds based on their scoring in preliminary online competition rounds that began on April 7. Scoring in TopCoder competitions is based on two factors: intensity, or the ability to use a particular coding language well under the pressure of peer-to-peer competition; and velocity, the ability to write good code quickly and accurately. Scores are calculated using TopCoder's objective assessment model and unique rating system, designed to fairly and accurately gauge a contestant's performance.</P>
<P>For the Collegiate Challenge, the 16 finalists have been divided into four groups of four, based on the ratings they have earned over the course of competition. Each group's first place winner will then advance to the final championship round on June 7 from 10:00 a.m. to 12 p.m. (PDT) with an awards ceremony to follow. All competition rounds can be viewed live, online at www.topcoder.com.</P>
