<h3>TOPCODER COMPETITION ASSIGNMENT Version 2.0</h3>

<p>THIS ASSIGNMENT ("Assignment") is made by and between the individual identified below ("Participant") and TopCoder, Inc.,
95 Glastonbury Blvd., Glastonbury, CT 06033, USA, ("TopCoder") and is effective as of the date given below, or if undated the
date the executed Assignment is received by TopCoder, for the purpose of confirming and granting to TopCoder rights in
Participant's submissions to TopCoder's competitions.</p>

<p>For good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged:</p>

<p>1. A "Covered Submission" is any Submission made by Participant in a Competition (other than a Competition in which the
Competition rules state that TopCoder does not require assignment or a Competition designated by TopCoder as an "Algorithm
Competition" held prior to February 1, 2008) prior to or after execution of this Assignment and for which TopCoder paid or pays to
Participant (or has in good faith made available for payment pending Participant's completion of TopCoder's payment requirements)
a cash prize and/or other compensation. "Submission" means any and all notes, drawings, designs, graphics, images, photographs,
technical data, know how, firmware, software, source code, data, review comments, suggestions, works of authorship, material,
information, work, or product submitted by Participant to TopCoder in connection with a Competition, and any ideas,
improvements, or inventions that are embodied in them. "Competition" means any competition operated in part or in whole by
TopCoder and in which Participant has participated or participates (for example, as a contestant or reviewer).</p>

<p>2. All rights in the Covered Submissions shall be the sole and exclusive property of TopCoder. Participant hereby assigns,
grants, transfers, and sets over to, and agrees to assign, grant, transfer, and set over to TopCoder all right, title and interest
throughout the world, along with any and all copyright, patent, trade secret, moral right, and other intellectual property rights, in and
to such Covered Submissions. To the extent any rights in a Covered Submission are not assignable, Participant hereby grants and
agrees to grant to TopCoder under any and all such rights an irrevocable, paid-up, royalty free, perpetual, exclusive, sublicensable
(directly or indirectly through multiple tiers), transferable, and worldwide license to use and permit others to use such Submission in
any manner desired by TopCoder (and/or its contest sponsors or customers) without restriction or accounting to Participant,
including, without limitation, the right to make, have made, sell, offer for sale, use, rent, lease, import, copy, prepare derivative
works, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute all or any part of such Submission and modifications and combinations
thereof and to sublicense (directly or indirectly through multiple tiers) or transfer any and all such rights. Further, Participant hereby
waives and agrees to waive in favor of TopCoder any moral right or other right or claim that is contrary to the intent of a complete
transfer of rights to TopCoder in each Covered Submission.</p>

<p>3. Participant agrees to promptly execute such documents and perform such acts as TopCoder may reasonably require to
perfect TopCoder's entire right, title, and interest in and to each and every Covered Submission.</p>

<p>4. For all Submissions that are not Covered Submissions, Participant grants and agrees to grant to TopCoder a non-exclusive,
perpetual, irrevocable, paid-up, royalty-free, right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, create derivative works of,
and publish and distribute such Submission and/or derivative works in any form, medium or technology, including the right, at
TopCoder's sole discretion, to allow publication and redistribution by third parties, and Participant waives in favor of TopCoder any
and all applicable moral or other rights contrary to such license.</p>

<p>5. Participant represents and warrants that Participant is the sole and original author, designer, and inventor of each
Submission and that Participant has not and shall not incorporate into any Submission any material from any other person unless so
specified by TopCoder. Participant further represents and warrants that, to Participant's knowledge, all of Participant's Submissions
are and shall be free and clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances or demands of third parties, including without limitation intellectual
property rights, and Participant is not obligated to assign or transfer rights in such Submissions to any other party. Participant
represents and warrants that Participant is legally able and entitled under the laws of Participant's jurisdiction to enter into this
Assignment and to grant to TopCoder the rights described in this Assignment.</p>

<p>6. This Assignment and all aspects of the relationship between the parties hereto shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of Connecticut and the United States of America, without regard to
its conflict of laws provisions. The parties hereby agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of Connecticut for
the resolution of any disputes regarding the subject matter of this Assignment. The application of the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. In the event that any provision of this Assignment is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, to the extent consistent with the
intent of the parties as of the effective date. This Assignment may be delivered by facsimile or electronic copy, which shall have the
same effect as an original. In case of conflict between this Assignment and any earlier Competition assignments from Participant to
TopCoder, this Assignment shall control. TopCoder can assign this Assignment without restriction, and all rights under this
Assignment shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by TopCoder's successors and assigns. This Assignment is personal to
Participant and may not be assigned without TopCoder's written consent.</p>
