Each component posted for a development competition will carry a "placement point" value equivalent to the prize money for the component. <A href="/tc?module=Static&d1=digital_run&d2=2007dot5&d3=devOverview">Placement Points</A> will be awarded based on the number of submissions that pass review. By registering for any development competition, a competitor agrees to the items outlined on each component's Project Overview page, including the Eligibility requirements and the Terms of Work, and the completion of all paperwork required by TopCoder.
<br><br>
TopCoder reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to revoke any and all privileges associated with competing in component development competitions, and to take any other action it deems appropriate, for no reason or any reason whatsoever, including if TopCoder suspects competitors of cheating, tampering with the entry process, the operation of the Web site or the challenge process, or other violation of any rule. TopCoder reserves the right to cancel, terminate or modify this program if it is not capable of completion as planned for any reason, including infection by computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention or technical failures of any sort. TopCoder reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change any aspects of the component development competitions, including but not limited to, the software methodology, the scorecard and the point distribution schedule, at any point during this program. TopCoder makes no guarantee as to the number of components that are open for competition in any particular development language for each weekly competition.
