<p><strong>MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, July 7, 2005 &#151;</strong>VeriSign, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRSN), the leading provider of intelligent infrastructure services for the Internet and telecommunications networks, today announced that it is a premium sponsor of the 2005 TopCoder Open (TCO).

As part of its agreement with TopCoder, VeriSign is sponsoring two initial single-round matches, occurring on July 7 and September 27, 2005, as well as the final rounds. In the initial matches, participants will be faced with a coding problem they must solve using either Java, C++, Microsoft Visual C#.NET or Microsoft Visual Basic.NET.  Winners will proceed to the next round, and the onsite finals will take place on October 12 - 14, 2005 in Santa Clara, CA.
