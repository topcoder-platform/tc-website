Some people like to play tennis or golf to blow off steam after a hard day.
<br/><br/>
Bolek Szewcyzk likes to pound out line after line after line of code on his computer, solving complex problems or just exulting in the art of creation.
<br/><br/>
"It's a ton of fun," said the 23-year-old college student from Warsaw, Poland. "It's like a game. Once you start you can't stop."
<br/><br/>
Szewcyzk was definitely in his element Friday, surrounded by 49 of the world's top computer programmers at Google's Mountain View headquarters. The event was the Google Code Jam, a digital shootout to see which programmer could solve a series of progressively harder programming puzzles.
<br/><br/>
The winner - Sergio Sancho of Argentina - took home $10,000 and a chance to impress Google engineers and perhaps land a job with the world's most famous search engine.
<br/><br/>
The challenge is both a recruiting tool for Google and a way for the company to nurture programmers it will need to draw on as it continues to grow.
<br/><br/>
"We have hired people out of it," said Alan Eustace, vice president of resources and systems engineering at Google. "But I don't think that's what is most important. We're trying to appeal to the community of problem-solvers. The more actively you support the community, the more active it becomes, and the more chances you'll have people you want to hire."
<br/><br/>
The competition started in September, with a qualification round that winnowed the group of 5,000 entrants. Successive competitions narrowed the field to 50 competitors who received expenses-paid trips to the finals.
<br/><br/>
Contestants came from 17 countries and many of the top schools in the country, including MIT and the California Institute of Technology.
<br/><br/>
Google lined up the programmers at rows of Dell computers in a large, high-ceilinged meeting room. About a fourth brought their own keyboards; some propped good luck charms such as stuffed animals next to their tubes.
<br/><br/>
The group had a little over an hour to tackle three problems. One involved organizing information to make it easily accessible. Another required the coders to order elements on a matrix. The third problem involved a game and required contestants to write a program that makes a series of moves until just one peg is left on a board.
<br/><br/>
"The first two seemed pretty easy," said 19-year-old Hubert Hwang from Brookline, Mass. "The third one was just plain hard."
<br/><br/>
The programmers were judged on speed and accuracy, and had to pass through a challenge round in which others could challenge their results.
<br/><br/>
The event was organized by TopCoder, a 4-year-old Connecticut company that holds similar competitions around the world and helps connect recruiters with potential employees.
<br/><br/>
True to the stereotype of the nerdy male programmer, there were no women in the contest.
<br/><br/>
Eustace handed the winners their trophies, made out of Legos. (In their early days, Google's founders crafted hard disk drives out of Lego-like toys called Duplo.)
<br/><br/>
The programmers came from varied backgrounds and have different ambitions. One wrote his first program at age 6 on a Macintosh Plus computer. Some were there to impress Google recruiters. Others want to pursue careers in academia. All of them share a passion for beautiful and functional code.
<br/><br/>
"I guess I enjoy the thrill of problem-solving," Hwang said. "It's kind of a strange thing, I suppose. But it's what I do."
