<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p align="center"><strong>A Part of the Microsoft Connected Services Framework Mashup Service Design and Development Competition Series</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Official Rules (Supplemental)</strong></p>

<p><strong>NO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN. A PURCHASE WILL NOT INCREASE YOUR CHANCE OF WINNING.  VOID WHERE PROHIBITED.</strong></p> 

<p><strong>For ELIGIBILITY, ENTRANCE and GENERAL CONDITIONS, see the <a href="/?module=Static&d1=rules ">Official Rules for the Contest Series</a>.</strong></p> 

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>
BT Group is the largest telecommunications provider in the UK, and one of the largest communications providers globally, providing managed voice and data services to clients in over 150 countries globally. BT is undergoing a complete transformation. At the heart of this transformation is our $20 billion 21st century network (21CN) initiative. An IP-based, multi-service network, 21CN is the driver for a radical change.
</p>
<p>
BT is looking for the best mashup ideas for their ground-breaking project, code-named Web21C, which exposes a number of capabilities to developers as Web Services, allowing applications to harness the power of the networking capabilities of BT. 
</p>
<p>
A core component of BT's Web21C platform will be Microsoft's Connected Services Framework (CSF) which provides the common service capabilities (service creation, deployment, execution, and management) for Microsoft-compliant applications connecting to BT's services and network.
</p>
<p>
For this contest, you are asked to develop a prototype mashup application that was the winner of the 1st CSF Mashup Design Competition.  The prototype mashup must run in within the CSF Sandbox here: <A href="http://www.networkmashups.com">www.networkmashups.com</A>.
</p>
<p>
Mashing together BT services, Microsoft web services/technologies, <A href="http://software.topcoder.com/catalog/c_showroom.jsp?cat=5801777">TopCoder Components</A>, and third party web services and content (as long as it is free and publicly available for commercial use), you can unleash your ideas, your curiosities, and your talents towards prototyping a usable mashup.
</p>

<p><strong>Representing Your Idea</strong></p>
<p>
Your goal for this competition is to prototype the mashup idea in the Specification document below. Think like a user. 
</p>
<p>
Entries must be your original work, and must not infringe on the copyright or licenses of others.

<p><strong>Discretionary Prizes</strong></p>
<p>
BT may choose at its discretion to have more winners than the three outlined above. In such cases, the above competition terms would apply and prize monies would be determined within the above range. 
</p>
<p><strong>Final Deliverables From Winner</strong></p>

<p>
The winner must deliver the following final files: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Full sources for the mashup implementation.</li>
<li>A VS.NET solution file or NAnt build script set up to fully build the mashup implementation.</li>

    <ul>
    <li>This document should also contain a section listing all (if any) of the TopCoder components that were used in the prototype.</li>
    </ul>
