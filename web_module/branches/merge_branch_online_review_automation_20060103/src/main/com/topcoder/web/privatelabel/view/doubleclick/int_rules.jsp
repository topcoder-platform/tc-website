			<p><span class="dc_subTitle">Summary of the Tournament</span><br/>
			The DoubleClick&#153; 2004 Coding Challenge ("DCCC") is being offered by DoubleClick Inc. ("DoubleClick") and TopCoder, Inc. ("TopCoder").  The DCCC will take place between Monday, February 2 and Friday, February 27, 2004.  It begins with a two-week online registration, after which all registered employees will be eligible to participate in the programming tournament.  The tournament takes place online and consists of one (1) main competition round and one (1) final round.  All participants who compete in the main competition round will receive a DoubleClick 2004 Coding Challenge T-shirt.  In addition, DoubleClick will award prizes worth up to $10,000 to the 10 finalists in the tournament.</p>

         <a name="eligibility"></a>
			<p><span class="dc_subTitle">Eligibility</span><br/>
			All DoubleClick employees as of February 2, 2004 are eligible to compete in the DCCC.  For the purpose of this tournament, "employee" is defined as full-time employee, part-time employee or intern.  Consultants are not eligible to participate.</p>

			<p><span class="dc_subTitle">Registration</span><br/>
			Registration will open on Monday, February 2 at 12:00PM ET and will close on Sunday, February 15 at 12:00PM ET.  Individuals can only register once.</p>

			<p><span class="dc_subTitle">Competition Advancement</span><br/>
			All registered DoubleClick employees will be eligible to compete in the main competition round.  Participants will be randomly assigned to specific virtual rooms, with up to 10 people in each room.  TopCoder will determine room assignments prior to the start of the main competition round.  The top 10 scorers from across all virtual rooms in the main competition round will advance to the final round.</p>

         <a name="about"></a>
			<p><span class="dc_subTitle">About the Tournament</span><br/>
			<span class="dc_subTitle">Use of Plugins in the Competition Arena</span><br/>
			The use of external TopCoder Arena plugins or any modifications to the Competition Arena functionality is strictly prohibited.</p>

			<p><span class="dc_subTitle">Logging in to the Tournament</span><br/>
			Everyone who competes in the tournament must log in to the Competition Arena no later than ten minutes prior to the start of each round.  If a participant does not participate, for any reason, in a round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition.</p>

			<p><span class="dc_subTitle">Scoring and Advancing</span><br/>
			After the results of the main competition have been compiled, the top 10 scorers from across all virtual rooms will be identified and will advance to the final round.  Each participant must have positive (i.e., greater than zero) points to advance, so if there are less than 10 participants who score positive points, only those participants with a positive point total will advance.  Participant advancement is determined by aggregating the total point values from all three phases of the round (see <a href="#structure">Competition Round Structure</a>) for each participant.</p>

			<p>NOTE:  In the event of a tie for any advancing position from the main competition round to the final round, all tied participants will advance to the final round.</p>

         <a name="structure"></a>
			<p><span class="dc_subTitle">Competition Round Structure</span><br/>
			Each round of competition consists of three phases: the Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase.</p>

			<ul>
			<li>The <b>Coding Phase</b> is a timed event where all participants are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earning potential. Points for a question are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.</li>

			<li>The <b>Challenge Phase</b> is a timed event wherein each participant has a chance to challenge the functionality of other participants' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 50 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.</li>

			<li>The <b>System Testing Phase</b> is a series of automated tests applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a participant's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the global set of test cases that are used in the System Testing Phase to test all submitted code.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><span class="dc_subTitle">Final Round</span><br/>
			The 10 advancers from the main competition round will compete in the final round of the tournament being held online on Friday, February 27, 2004 at 1:00PM ET.  Each finalist must confirm his/her attendance in the final round by 5:00PM ET on Tuesday, February 24, 2004.  If a participant does not confirm his/her attendance in the final round by that time, he/she will forfeit eligibility to receive a prize, and his/her spot in the final round will be given to the next highest scorer from the main competition round.</p>

			<p>The final round will be a single virtual room of 10 participants, all 10 of whom will win a prize, depending on how each places in the round.  The participant with the highest point value in the final round will be declared the first place winner.  In the event of a tie in the final round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order):</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during the main competition round</li>
			<li>If a tie still remains in the final round, then all tied participants will win the applicable prize</li>
			</ul>

         <a name="prizes"></a>
			<p><span class="dc_subTitle">About the Prizes</span><br/>
			All participants who compete in the main competition round will receive a DoubleClick 2004 Coding Challenge T-shirt.  In addition, the 10 finalists in the final round will receive prizes.  Any and all applicable taxes on prizes are the sole responsibility of the prizewinner.  Prizes will be distributed as follows:</p>
