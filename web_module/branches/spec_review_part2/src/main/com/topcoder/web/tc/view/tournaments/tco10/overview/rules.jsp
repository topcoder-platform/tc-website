                            <p>The Tournament is brought to you by TopCoder, Inc. and is designed to showcase the most prestigious members in the TopCoder community. The Tournament consists of several competitions: Algorithm, Design, Development, Marathon, Mod Dash, and Studio Design (each a "Competition").

                            <h3 class="subTitle">General Submission Requirements</h3><!-- sub title-->
                            <p>All Competitors participating in a Competition will see a Submit option. Clicking the Submit link will take the Competitor to a page that will allow the Competitor to upload information about their submission in the Competition ("Submission").</p>

                            <h3 class="subTitle">General Information About Prizes</h3><!-- sub title-->
                            <p>All cash prizes are listed and shall be awarded in USD. All prizes will be awarded in each Competition, provided a qualified number of Submissions are received and the requisite number of Competitors participate in a Round of a Competition. If a Competitor cannot or will not accept a prize, then the prize will be forfeited and may be awarded to the next highest scoring Submission.</p>
                            <p>Unless otherwise provided herein, by participating in the Tournament and a Competition, a Competitor acknowledges and agrees that if his/her Submission is selected as a winner, the Competitor will receive a cash award only upon verification of all applicable eligibility requirements. Cash prizes will be paid out by TopCoder (or its designee) in the US in US dollars no later than 90 days following the conclusion of the Tournament and Competition. Taxes, if any, are the sole responsibility of the winner(s). Prizes which remain unclaimed or undeliverable for a period of six (6) months will be forfeited.</p>
                            <p>As a condition of winning and redeeming a cash prize, Competitors will be required to submit a completed (i) Competitor Questionnaire, (ii) Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release, unless a notarized copy is already on file with TopCoder (iii) IRS Form W-9 or W-8BEN, as appropriate if one is not already on file with TopCoder, (iv) TopCoder Competition Assignment Agreement, if one is not already on file with TopCoder, (v) Travel form, and (vi) brief video introduction.

                            <h3 class="subTitle">License to Submissions</h3><!-- sub title-->
                            <p>As a condition of participation, Competitors hereby grant a perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to TopCoder (a) to use, reproduce and publish Submissions or material submitted in connection with the Tournament or Competition; (b) to publicly display, and/or feature your Submission and all its content and all submitted material in connection with the promotion of the Tournament or the Competition in all media (now known or later developed); and (c) store your Submission, its content and submitted material on TopCoder's servers, for marketing purposes, and/or for the promotion of the Tournament and/or the Competition. You agree to sign any necessary documentation that may be required by TopCoder or its designees to make use of the rights you granted above. You also understand and acknowledge that TopCoder, any Tournament or Competition sponsor(s), and/or other Competitors may have developed or commissioned materials similar or identical to your Submission and you waive any claims you may have resulting from any similarities to your Submission.</p>
                            <p>Nothing in these Rules shall be construed as granting you any right or license under any intellectual property right of TopCoder or any Tournament or Competition sponsor(s) (including any rights they may have in any patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks or any trade secrets) or in TopCoder's web site, by implication, highestoppel or otherwise, except as may be expressly set forth herein.</p>

                            <h3 class="subTitle">Confirmation</h3><!-- sub title-->
                            <p>All Competitors who have advanced or won a trip to the onsite portion of the Tournament ("Onsite Competitors") must arrive at The Mirage no later than 17:00 UTC -7 on Monday, October 11, 2010. All Onsite Competitors must confirm their attendance at the onsite event no later than 17:00 UTC -4 on Monday, August 23, 2010. In order to confirm attendance, Onsite Competitors must have acquired any necessary travel visas and confirm their ability to travel to the United States no later than August 23, 2010. If an Onsite Competitor is required to travel from outside the United States, the Onsite Competitor must show proof of a visa and/or passport by 17:00 UTC -4 on August 23, 2010. Onsite Competitors may email a copy of their documents to Jessie D'Amato Ford. Onsite Competitors who fail to meet this requirement may be replaced as an Onsite Competitor.</p>
                            <p>Competitors who are otherwise eligible to compete in any or all of the Competitions will be permitted to participate in the online portions of any/all of them. However, in the event a Competitor advances to the onsite finals in more than one Competition and any of the times for the onsite rounds of the Competitions overlap, the Onsite Competitor may participate in either, but not both, Competitions. The Onsite Competitor must notify TopCoder of the Competition in which s/he will participate as an Onsite Competitor no later than August 23, 2010.</p>

                           <h3 class="subTitle">Visa Assistance</h3><!-- sub title-->
                            <p>TopCoder will issue visa invitation letters (upon request) to international Competitors who require one to obtain a travel visa to enter the United States. All Competitors that have passed screening for at least one online Competition will receive a visa invitation letter request form. Competitors must fill out the form in its entirety before a visa letter will be mailed. Competitors have until 17:00 GMT -4 on July 30, 2010 to request a letter. Visas can take a significant amount of time to obtain in certain countries, so it is in a Competitor's best interests to request one well before the deadline. The cost of obtaining a visa is the sole responsibility of the Competitor. See more information about <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wiki/display/tc/Getting+your+Visa+and+Getting+it+Early">travel visas</a>.</p>
                            <p>The Tournament involves a large number of visa applications by TopCoder members. By applying for a visa to attend the Tournament, you understand that TopCoder will cooperate with all requests by consulates, the Department of Homeland Security, and law enforcement in connection with such Competitor's visa, including information about the visa applicants' attendance at the Tournament. Any abuse of the visa application process or any visa obtained for the Tournament is considered a serious violation of US law and these Rules, and, among other things, the Competitor will be subject to discipline by TopCoder.</p>


                            <h3 class="subTitle">Travel Details</h3><!-- sub title-->
                            <p>TopCoder will provide air travel arrangements for each Onsite Competitor. The flight will be reserved and paid for by TopCoder. Onsite Competitors will arrive on Monday, October 11, 2010 and depart on Friday, October 15, 2010. At TopCoder's sole discretion, TopCoder will pay for each Onsite Competitor's airfare up to $1,500, but reserves the right to make exceptions to the maximum amount based on individual circumstances. If an Onsite Competitor wishes to take a flight other than the one provided by TopCoder and/or wishes to stay at a hotel other than The Mirage, the Onsite Competitor shall be responsible for the entire cost of such deviation from the accommodations and travel arrangements provided by TopCoder. In addition, the Onsite Competitor agrees to reimburse TopCoder for any costs, penalties, fines or fees incurred by TopCoder as a result of such deviation.</p>
                            <p>Ground transportation to and from McCarran International Airport will be provided for each Onsite Competitor by TopCoder, as well as hotel accommodations and certain meals. All other expenses are the responsibility of the Onsite Competitor. TopCoder will not provide travel, lodging accommodations, or visa assistance for any guests of an Onsite Competitor.</p>
                            <p>If an Onsite Competitor is eliminated for any reason after he/she is confirmed as a finalist and travel accommodations have already been made for the Onsite Competitor by TopCoder for the onsite finals, that Onsite Competitor may be held responsible for reimbursing TopCoder for the cost of such accommodations. TopCoder reserves the right to withhold any future cash prizes won by the Onsite Competitor until the cost of such accommodations has been fully reimbursed.</p>
                            <p>Onsite Competitors must complete the following items and submit them to TopCoder by 17:00 UTC -4 on Monday, August 23, 2010 (failure to submit these items will disqualify an Onsite Competitor from advancing to the onsite event):</p>
