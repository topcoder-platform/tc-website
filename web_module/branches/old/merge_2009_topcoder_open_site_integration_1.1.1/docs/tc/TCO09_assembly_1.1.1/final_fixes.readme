2.1.1 - Recommended: I added the requested vaidation to the code.
2.1.7 - Required: After discussing this with the PMs we agreed to do the following: (please contact PM to verify)
        1) Keep styles as they are - it's not relevant.
        2) Link studio handles to studio leaderboard.
        3) Remove extra (first) table title in all leaderboards (when it has duplicated "leaderboard" text)
3.2.1 - Recommended: please note PM corrected the score and this is not needed.
      
Thank you!
