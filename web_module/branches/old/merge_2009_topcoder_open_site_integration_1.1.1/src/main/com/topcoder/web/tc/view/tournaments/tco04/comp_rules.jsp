            between August 10th and November 12th, 2004.  It will consist of two competitions - the design competition
            and the development competition.  Each competition will consist of three (3) online rounds taking place over
            the course of six (6) weeks and one (1) final online round, being the Championship Round.  The prize purse
            for this tournament is $100,000 in cash, with $64,200 being awarded in the design competition and $35,800
            in the development competition.  The four (4) competitors in each competition with the highest cumulative
            placement scores after the three (3) online rounds will advance to the online Championship Round, the
            results of which will be announced at the Santa Clara Marriott in Santa Clara, California, USA on November

			<p>Those members who are eligible to compete in both the Algorithm Competition of the TCO and in the CDDC
			will be permitted to participate in both.  In addition, members will be allowed to compete in both the
			design and development competitions of the CDDC.  However, if one member participates in both the design
			and development competitions AND qualifies as one of the finalists in each, then the member will only be
			permitted to advance to the Championship Round in one of the competitions.  The following criteria will
			be used to determine which competition the member will advance to:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>The member will advance to the competition in which he/she achieved a higher cumulative placement score.
				(Details of how the placement scoring is calculated are provided below.)</li>
				<li>If the member's cumulative placement score is the same for both competitions, then the member
				will choose the competition in which he/she will compete.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Employees of TopCoder, Inc. and Microsoft, Inc. and those involved in the production (including prize suppliers), implementation
			and distribution of this contest and their advertising or promotion agencies, parent companies, service providers,

            </a>Placement Scoring</h3>

            <p>Scoring in the CDDC is determined based on the placement for each submission. Placement is determined based on the
            score awarded for a particular component. For example, if 3 submissions were received for one Level 1 component and the
            scores were 93, 89, and 71, the member receiving the score of 93 would be in 1st place and would receive 10 points. In
            order to receive placement points the submission must pass the minimum component score of 70. Placement scoring is as follows: </p>

            </a>Scoring and Advancing</h3>

            <p>
            During each week of competition, eligible competitors can submit design and development solutions for at least one
            eligible component by the submission due date.  Submissions will be scored by the TopCoder Review Boards and will
            be subject to final review and appeal in the same manner as standard component design and development submissions.
            Scoring of each submission by the TopCoder Review Boards is based on the criteria outlined in the
            <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=dev&d2=support&d3=devReviewSample">Development Review Scorecard</a>
            for the Development Contest or the criteria outlined in the
            <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=dev&d2=support&d3=desReviewSample">Design Review Scorecard</a> for the
            Design Contest.  <strong>SUBMISSIONS MUST BE RECEIVED DURING EACH ROUND'S SUBMISSION TIMELINE TO BE CONSIDERED A
            VIABLE ENTRY.  THERE WILL BE NO EXCEPTIONS.</strong></p>


            <p>There will be no elimination of contestants during the three (3) online rounds.  Round winners will be those participants
            with the highest cumulative placement score for each round.  Prizes will be awarded to the 1st and 2nd place finishers
            in each round.  In the case of a tie for any prize-winning position in any online round other than the Championship Round,
            the prize money will be distributed equally among the tied participants.</p>

            <p>Up to the three (3) highest individual placement scores that each contestant receives for his/her submissions throughout
            the six (6) weeks of competition will be added together for a cumulative placement score.  The four (4) competitors in each
            competition with the highest cumulative placement score will advance to the online Championship
            Round.  There will be no onsite portion of the Championship Round. A review of the CDDC by TopCoder Review Board members and
            the announcement of the winners in each competition will be made onsite on November 12th.</p>

            <p>In the event of a tie of cumulative placement score among the advancers to the Championship Round, the tie will
            be resolved in the following manner:</p>

            <ol>
            	<li>Highest cumulative component score of the lesser number of components used to develop the cumulative placement
            	score for the tied competitors. </li>

            	<li>If a tie still remains, then the highest individual component score of the lesser number of components used to
            	develop the cumulative placement score for the tied competitors.</li>

            	<li>If a tie still remains, then all tied contestants will advance to the online Championship Round.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Example:</span><br/>
            Contestant #1 submits three components in the design competition, earning the following component and placement scores:</p>

            <p>Component #1 - score 88.45; placement 2; placement score 7<br/>
			Component #2 - score 76.33; placement 3; placement score 5<br/>
			Component #3 - score 82.89; placement 3; placement score 5</p>

            <p>Cumulative placement score: 7 + 5 + 5 = 17</p>

            <p>Contestant #2 submits two components in the design competition, earning the following component and placement scores:</p>

            <p>Component #1 - score 92.56; placement 1; placement score 10<br/>
			Component #2 - score 75.83; placement 2; placement score 7</p>

            <p>Cumulative placement score: 10 + 7 = 17</p>

            <p>To determine who advances to Championship Round, look at the highest cumulative component score of the
            lesser number of components used to develop the cumulative placement score for the tied competitors.</p>

            <p>Contestant #1: 88.45 + 82.89 = 171.34<br/>
			Contestant #2: 92.56 + 75.83 = 168.39</p>

			<p>Contestant #1 would advance to the Championship Round.</p>

			<p>The Championship Round will be a single online round of four (4) competitors in each competition.  Two winners
			will be crowned onsite, one Design Champion and one Development Champion.  Each champion will be the member who
			receives the highest score on his/her final component submission in each competition.  </p>


            <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Championship Tiebreaker:</span><br/>
            In the event of a tie in the Championship Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order):</p>


            <ol>
            	<li>By cumulative placement score as of the end of the three (3) online rounds (highest cumulative placement score wins).</li>
            	<li>If a tie still remains, then by highest cumulative component score of the lesser number of components used to develop the cumulative placement score for the tied competitors.</li>
            	<li>If a tie still remains, then the prize money will be distributed equally among the tied members.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Onsite Participation</span><br/>
            The four (4) participants in the Championship Round in each competition will travel to the Santa Clara
            Marriott on Wednesday, November 10th.  Announcement of the CDDC winners will be made on November 12th.
            All contestants must arrive at the Santa Clara Marriott no later than 4:00 PM PT on Wednesday, November 10th.
            If a contestant is unable to attend the onsite event, he/she will forfeit his/her eligibility to receive a prize.</p>

            <p>TopCoder will provide travel arrangements for each competitor up to a cost of $1,000 per person.
            (That is, if a contestant's airfare is greater than $1,000, the contestant will be responsible for the difference
            between the cost of the airfare and $1,000.)  TopCoder will provide ground transportation to and from the airport, as well
            as accommodations and certain meals for each contestant.  All other expenses are the responsibility of the contestant.
            TopCoder will not provide travel or lodging accommodations for competitor guests at the 2004 TopCoder Open.</p>

		for this or similar future tournaments, and to use the statements made by, or attributed to, the winners relating to TopCoder
		and any and all rights to said use, without further compensation.  Furthermore, all prizewinners agree to promptly notify
		TopCoder if a non-sponsor third-party contacts the prizewinner regarding employment opportunities and/or media interest as a result of
		the prizewinner's participation in the tournament.</p>
