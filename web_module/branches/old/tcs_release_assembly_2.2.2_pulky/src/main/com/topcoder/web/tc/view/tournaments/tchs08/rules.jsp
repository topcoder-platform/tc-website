            <h3>Registration</h3>
            <p>Registration for the 2008 TopCoder High School Tournament will open at 9:00 AM EST on Monday, December 17, 2007, and will close at 5:00 PM EST on Thursday, January 10, 2008. In order to compete in the tournament, competitors must have registered prior to 5:00 PM EST on Thursday, January 10, 2008. In order to be eligible to compete in any portion of the TCHS Tournament, competitors must be a registered TopCoder High School member and have registered separately for the Tournament. There is no limit to the number of registrants for the tournament; however each individual may only register once.</p>
            
            <h3>Online Elimination Rounds</h3>
            <p>All members who have competed in at least three (3) rated TCHS SRMs between July 12, 2007 and January 12, 2008 and who have registered for the tournament are eligible to compete in Online Round 1.</p>
            <p>Everyone who competes in an online round must register for each round in the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than five (5) minutes prior to the start of the online round. TopCoder will communicate each Online Round in Eastern Standard Time (UTC/GMT -5). Contestants may be located and competing in time zones other than Eastern Standard Time and must adjust accordingly. If a coder does not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition.</p>
            <p>All competitors will be randomly assigned to virtual competition rooms. Rooms will be created such that each room has a maximum of 25 competitors. The number of rooms in each round is (the # of competitors who advanced to the round)/25.</p>
            <p>The dates and times of the online rounds of competition are as follows:</p>

            <h3>Scoring and Advancing during Online Rounds</h3>
            <p>After each Online Round, the highest scorers from across all rooms will be identified and will advance to the next online round. Coder advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round for each coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater-than-zero) point total. The structure of each Online Round is as follows:</p>
            <p><strong>Online Round 1</strong><br />
            All registered competitors will compete and up to 500 will advance. The highest 500 scoring competitors across all rooms will advance to Online Round 2.</p>
            <p><strong>Online Round 2</strong><br />
            Up to 500 competitors will compete and up to 100 will advance. The highest 100 scoring competitors across all rooms will advance to Online Round 3.</p>
            <p><strong>Online Round 3</strong><br />
            Up to 100 competitors will compete and up to 50 will advance. The highest 50 scoring competitors across all rooms will advance to the Onsite Finals.</p>
            <p>NOTE: In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the Online Rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during the previous round of competition.</li>
                    <li>If a tie still remains, then by best rating at the start of the tournament.</li>
                    <li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h3>Competition Round Structure</h3>
            <p>Each online and onsite round of competition consists of three phases: Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. (Note: The format of these competition rounds is similar to the format of TopCoder High School Single Round Matches. The rules in place for TCHS Single Round Matches as of January 12, 2008 will also apply to the online and onsite rounds of TCHS08.)</p>
            <p>The Coding Phase is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened until the time it was submitted.</p>
            <p>The Challenge Phase is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger. Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.</p>
            <p>The System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</p>
            
            <h3>Onsite Championship Round</h3>
            <p><strong>Important Information:<br /><br />
            Travel Confirmation</strong><br />
            The fifty (50) advancers from Online Round 3 will travel to the campus of Purdue University on Friday, March 14, 2008 to compete in the Final round of the TCHS08 Tournament being held on Saturday, March 15, 2008. All contestants must arrive at the campus of Purdue University no later than 4:00 PM EDT on Friday, March 14, 2008.</p>
            <p>All contestants must confirm their attendance at the onsite Championship round no later than 5:00 PM EST (UTC/GMT -5) on Monday, February 18, 2008. That is, contestants must have acquired any necessary travel visas and know for certain that they can travel to the U.S. by that date and time. In order for a finalist to confirm attendance for the onsite finals, it is necessary to show proof of visa and/or passport by the deadline (5:00 PM EST (UTC/GMT -5) on Monday, February 18, 2008) if the finalist is required for travel from outside the United States. Finalists may do this by emailing a copy of their documents to Jessie D'Amato Ford at <a href="mailto:jdamato@topcoder.com?subject=Confirmation of Attendance/Proof of Travel Documents">jdamato@topcoder.com</a>. Competitors who fail to meet this requirement by the deadline will not be able to attend the onsite finals and will be replaced as an onsite finalist.</p>
            
            <h3>Visa Assistance</h3>
            <p>At the end of Online Round 1, TopCoder will issue visa invitation letters at the request of international competitors who require one to obtain a travel visa to enter the United States. All competitors who advance to Online Round 2 will receive a visa invitation letter request form. Competitors have until 5:00 PM EST (GMT/UTC -5) on Friday, January 25, 2008 to request a letter. Visas can take a significant amount of time to obtain in certain countries; therefore, for those competitors who need a letter, it is in their best interest to request one well before the deadline. The cost of obtaining a visa is the sole responsibility of the competitor. If a competitor fails to request a visa invitation letter by the date above, TopCoder will not be able to assist in the visa process.</p>
            <p>TopCoder will provide air travel arrangements for each competitor. The flight will be reserved and paid for by TopCoder and will be for arrival on March 14, 2008 and departure on March 16 2008.TopCoder will pay for each competitor's airfare up to $1,500, though we reserve the right to make exceptions to the maximum amount based on individual circumstances. Extended flights and/or hotel room nights requested by a competitor that result in additional costs will be the responsibility of the competitor.</p>
            <p>Ground transportation to and from the Indianapolis International Airport will be provided for each competitor by TopCoder. Hotel accommodations and certain meals will be provided for each competitor as well. All other expenses are the responsibility of the competitor. TopCoder will not provide travel or lodging accommodations for guests or chaperones of the competitor.</p>

            </table>
            
            <p>The Championship Round will be a single round of fifty (50) coders.  The winning individual in the Championship Round will be the competitor with the highest score in the round. In the event of a tie in the Championship Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during Online Rounds #1, #2 and #3 of the 2008 TCHS Tournament</li>
                    <li>If a tie still remains in the Championship Round, then the prize will be distributed equally among the tied competitors.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h3>About the Prizes</h3>
