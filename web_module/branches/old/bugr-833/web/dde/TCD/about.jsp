								<p><strong>Why is it that there always seems too much work to do?  Why do we always seem to be waiting?  Waiting for someone to finish before we can move on?  Why is it that, even with all of the new tools, processes and methods, the list of things to do grows faster than what gets done?  Why is is that, no matter how hard we try - how much resource we add (and the cost that goes with it), users, customers and management never seem to be satisfied?</strong><br />
                                  <br />
                                  Enterprise IT today faces serious challenges.  With the explosion of information within and external to the enterprise, resource constrained IT has an increasingly difficult time keeping up with user requests.  Whether implementing and supporting enterprise class applications or responding to changes in existing systems or new technologies, resource constraints create contentious relationships with IT consumers as the organization tries to keep up.  There never seems to be enough money or resource to keep up with demand.  The net result is business functions that never seem to make the priority list, further adding to the frustration.<br />
                                  <br />
                                  <strong>In the internet age, shouldn't there be a better way? </strong><br />
                                  <br />
                                  TopCoder is a new paradigm in meeting the needs of users.  TopCoder is the first massively parallel, <strong>non-labor based</strong> end-to-end solution for the development of all things digital.  No matter how big or small the project, from requirements discovery to design, build and test for applications ranging from small web, mobile and internal departmental apps to large ERP, CRM and decision support development and implementation, TopCoder is a platform that provides instant access to a wealth of resource.  Through parallelization, competition and a deliverables based platform, IT drives the outcome instead of managing resources.  The TopCoder platform allows the enterprise to reach levels of reliability and quality that simply were not possible even a few years ago.  No longer constrained by <em>who</em> is doing the work, but able to focus on <em>what</em> is being accomplished, IT is freed to focus on adding real business value.  It's massive horsepower for the enterprise that <strong>you</strong> control.<br />
                                  <br />
                                You will see no talk of hours and rates here.  All pricing is by the deliverable.  Most importantly, that pricing is set by you.  Need to flesh out an idea,  graphic for a web page,  a new section of the web site or an entirely new web presence integrated to your supply chain and customer relationship system, the TopCoder platform can be plugged in to add scale to any problem - big or small.  It's the world at your fingertips.</p>
