"We've seen a dramatic growth in the component division - more than twice the number of participants registered this year compared to last year and that really shows it's the hottest area of interest in TopCoder competitions," said Rob Hughes, President and COO of TopCoder. "It's a perfect parallel to our TopCoder Software component competitions which allow members to win prize money online, 24 hours a day, seven days a week."
