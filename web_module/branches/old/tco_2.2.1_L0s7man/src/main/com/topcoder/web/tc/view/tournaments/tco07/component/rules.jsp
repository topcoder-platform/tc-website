<h2>Overview of the Tournament</h2>
<p>The 2007 TopCoder Open ("TCO") Component Design and Development Competition ("CDDC") will take place between February 19, 2007 and June 29, 2007. It will consist of two competitions - the design competition and the development competition. Each competition will consist of five (5) weeks of online qualifying competitions, three (3) weeks of online Championship rounds and one (1) onsite Championship round. The prize purse for this tournament is $100,000 in cash, with $60,000 being awarded for the design competition and $40,000 for the development competition. The eight (8) competitors in each competition with the highest cumulative placement scores after the online rounds of competition will advance to the onsite Championship round, being held at the Mirage in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA on June 26 - 29, 2007. </p>

<%--<a href="#top"><img src="/i/tournament/tco07/back_to_top.png" alt="back to top" border="0" align="right"></a>--%>
<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>
TopCoder members meeting the following eligibility criteria are eligible to compete in the CDDC: 
<ul>
<li>Must be at least 18 years of age as of March 15, 2007; AND </li>
<li>If not a US resident, must be living in, and participating from, your country of residence; AND </li>
<li>Must currently be eligible for participation in TopCoder Component projects (i.e. not suspended from TopCoder).</li>
</ul>

<p>
TopCoder members who are 18 years of age or older as of March 15, 2007 are eligible to win cash prizes, unless otherwise prohibited. The TopCoder Open is void in the Quebec province of Canada, and elsewhere where prohibited by applicable law. Cash prizes will not be paid to residents of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria. </li>
</p>
<p>
Employees of TopCoder, Inc. and of all official tournament sponsors, regardless of commitment date as sponsor, including any companies involved in the production (including prize suppliers), implementation and distribution of this tournament and their advertising or promotion agencies, parent companies, service providers, agents, officers, subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other persons or entities directly associated with the tournament and members of their immediate families (parent, child, sibling, and spouse of each) and/or persons living in the same household as such persons, are ineligible to enter the tournament. If a competitor's employer signs on as an official sponsor of the tournament after February 19, 2007, then that competitor will be removed from further participation in the tournament. TopCoder members who are performing internships for any official tournament sponsor between February 19 and June 29, 2007 are also ineligible to compete.
</p>
<p>
Those members who are eligible to compete in any of the four tournament competitions will be permitted to participate in any/all of them online.  However, in the event a member becomes a finalist in more than one competition and the onsite competition times overlap, the member will be forced to choose only one competition to participate in as a finalist by May 11, 2007. Members are allowed to compete in the online portions of both design and development competitions of the TCO. However, if a member participates in both the online design and development competitions and qualifies as one of the finalists in each, then the member will only be permitted to advance to the Championship round in only one of the competitions. The following criteria will be used to determine to which competition the member will advance: 
<ol>
<li>The member will advance to the competition in which he/she achieved a higher cumulative score. </li>
<li>If the member's cumulative placement score is the same for both competitions, then the member will choose the competition in which he/she will compete.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<a name="placement"></a>
<h2>Placement Scoring</h2>
<p>
Scoring in the CDDC is determined based on the placement for each submission. Placement is determined based on the score awarded for a particular component. For example, if 3 submissions were received for a component and the scores were 93, 89, and 71, the member receiving the score of 93 would be in 1st place and would receive 10 points. Note that only those registered for the tournament are considered when determining place and placement points. In order to receive placement points, a submission must pass the minimum component score of 75. Placement scoring is as follows: 
</p>

<div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 300px;"><strong>
1st Place - 10 Points<br>
2nd Place - 7 Points<br>
3rd Place - 5 points<br>
4th Place - 4 Points<br>
5th Place (and lower) - 0 Points 
</strong></div>

<p>
The placement points outlined are for both Level One and Level Two components. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Penalty points</b>
All final fixes will be completed according to the component schedule. If a competitor misses final fixes for a component, they will be docked one (1) placement point per day they are late with final fixes. The component manager will have final say on all penalties and deadlines. 
</p>
<p>
<a name="schedule"></a>
<h2>Schedule </h2>
<p>
Both the design and development competitions will have five (5) weeks of online competition and one (1) onsite Championship round. Each contestant participating in an online round must submit his/her design and/or development submission for components by the submission deadline as scheduled. TopCoder members from around the world may be participating in the online rounds, but all start times, registration deadlines and submission deadlines will be communicated as Eastern Time, so contestants in different time zones must adjust accordingly.

<a name="scoring"></a>
<h2>Scoring and Advancing </h2>
<p>
During each week of competition, eligible competitors can submit design and development solutions for at least one eligible component by the submission deadline. Submissions will be scored by the TopCoder Review Boards and will be subject to final review and appeal in the same manner as standard component design and development submissions. Scoring of each submission by the TopCoder Review Boards is based on the criteria outlined in the Development Review Scorecard for the Development Contest or the criteria outlined in the Design Review Scorecard for the Design Contest. Note that the scorecards to be used for the CDDC are the ones that are in effect as of March 15, 2007. ALL SUBMISSIONS MUST BE RECEIVED ACCORDING TO THE SUBMISSION DEADLINE TO BE CONSIDERED A VIABLE ENTRY. THERE WILL BE NO EXCEPTIONS. There will be no elimination of contestants during the online competition. 
</p>
<p>
Up to the four (4) highest individual placement scores that each contestant receives for his/her submissions throughout the five (5) weeks of competition will be added together for a cumulative placement score. Up to eight (8) competitors in each competition with the highest cumulative positive (i.e., greater than zero) placement score will advance to the onsite Championship round. 
</p>
<p>
In the event of a tie of cumulative placement score among the advancers to the Championship round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Highest cumulative component score of the lesser number of components used to develop the cumulative placement score for the tied competitors.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then the highest individual component score of the lesser number of components used to develop the cumulative placement score for the tied competitors. </li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then all tied contestants will advance to the online Championship round.</li> 
<li>Components where the competitor earned 0 points will not be counted towards tiebreaker scores. </li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Contestant #1 submits three components in the design competition, earning the following component and placement scores: 
</p>
<p>
Component #1 - score 88.45; placement 2; placement score 7<br>
Component #2 - score 76.33; placement 3; placement score 5<br>
Component #3 - score 82.89; placement 3; placement score 5 <br>
<br><br>
Cumulative placement score: 7 + 5 + 5 = 17 
</p>
<p>
Contestant #2 submits two components in the design competition, earning the following component and placement scores: 
</p>
<p>
Component #1 - score 92.56; placement 1; placement score 10<br>
Component #2 - score 75.83; placement 2; placement score 7 <br>
<br><br>
Cumulative placement score: 10 + 7 = 17 
</p>
<p>
To determine who advances to Championship round, look at the highest cumulative component score of the lesser number of components used to develop the cumulative placement score for the tied competitors. 
</p>
<p>
Contestant #1: 88.45 + 82.89 = 171.34<br>
Contestant #2: 92.56 + 75.83 = 168.39 <br>
<br><br>
Contestant #1 would advance to the Championship round. 
</p>

<h2>Onsite Semifinal and Championship Rounds</h2>
<h3>Important Information</h3>
<p>
<b>Travel Confirmation</b><br>
Up to eight (8) advancers in each competition from the five (5) weeks of online competition will travel to the Mirage on Tuesday, June 26, 2007 to compete in the final competitive stage of the tournament being held on Wednesday, June 27 - Friday, June 29, 2007. All contestants must arrive at the Mirage no later than 4:00 PM PDT on Tuesday, June 26, 2007. 
</p>
<p>
All contestants must confirm their attendance at the onsite rounds no later than 5:00 PM EDT (UTC/GMT -4) on Friday, May 4, 2007. That is, contestants must have acquired any necessary travel visas and know for certain that they can travel to the U.S. by that date and time.  In order for a finalist to confirm attendance for the onsite finals, it is necessary to show proof of visa and/or passport by the deadline (5:00 PM EDT (UTC/GMT -4) on Friday, May 4, 2007) if the finalist is required to travel from outside the United States. Finalists may do this by emailing a copy of their documents to Jessie D'Amato Ford at jford@topcoder.com. Competitors who fail to meet this requirement by the deadline will not be able to attend the onsite finals and will be replaced as an onsite finalist. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Visa Assistance</b><br>
TopCoder will issue visa invitation letters at the request of international competitors who require one to obtain a travel visa to enter the United States. All competitors that pass screening on at least one component, will receive a request form to fill out if they require a letter.  As soon as a competitor fills out the form in its entirety, their letter will be shipped out by FedEx International Priority mail.  Competitors have until 5:00 PM EDT (GMT/UTC -4) on Friday, Monday, April 23, 2007 to request a letter. Visas can take a significant amount of time to obtain in certain countries; therefore, for those competitors who need a letter, it is in their best interest to request one well before the deadline. The cost of obtaining a visa is the sole responsibility of the competitor. If you fail to request a visa invitation letter by the date above, TopCoder will not assist you in the process of obtaining a travel visa. See more information about <A href="/tc?module=Static&d1=tournaments&d2=tco07&d3=getVisa">travel visas</A>.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Travel Details</b><br>
TopCoder will provide air travel arrangements for each competitor. The flight reserved by and paid for by TopCoder is for arrival on June 26, 2007 and departure on June 30, 2007 (or July 1, 2007 if the cost is significantly less to fly out a day later).  TopCoder will pay for each competitor's airfare up to $1,500, however we will do what we believe is reasonable given each individual circumstance (e.g., if the most reasonably convenient ticket itinerary is a little more than $1,500, TopCoder will pay for the entire cost).  Extended flights and/or hotel room nights requested by a competitor that result in additional costs will be the responsibility of the competitor and will be deducted from the competitor's total TCO prize money won. 
</p>
<p>
TopCoder will also provide ground transportation to and from the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, as well as hotel accommodations and meals for each contestant. All other expenses are the responsibility of the contestant. 
</p>
<p>
TopCoder will not provide travel or lodging accommodations for competitor guests at the 2007 TCO. 
</p>
<h2>Online portion of Championship Round: </h2>
<p>
Each finalist will compete on the same set of components online. Three (3) component competitions will be open to only the finalists. Finalists that do not submit for a project will receive the minimum possible score for that project. The component competition will be run according to the standard TopCoder component competition rules, and will have a component prize independent from the TCO. However the appeals phase for each component will be done onsite, so none of the competitors will know the score of any component prior to the onsite round. Component winners will be required to complete their final fixes after the conclusion of the TCO. 
</p>
<h2>Onsite portion of Championship Round: </h2>
<p>
Each competitor will be given one hundred (100) points to spread across all three finals component. The competition for each round will begin with each competitor choosing the points to allocate to their component. Each competitor may risk a maximum of sixty (60) points and minimum of ten (10) points on an individual component. The number of points awarded is the floor of the points wagered divided by the placement standing. For instance see the table below:

<p>
The order of components used in the competition will be determined by TopCoder and each component to be reviewed will be revealed to the competitor at the start of the round. All final round components will have been pre-reviewed prior to coming on site. The competitor will have one (1) hour to appeal their scorecard. After one hour all appeals must be completed. 
</p>
<p>
As the appeals are occurring, the review board will be actively answering the filed appeals. The scores will be adjusted real time to the audience and competitors. After the appeals phase has ended, the review board will respond to the unanswered appeals by the start of the next round when the round winners are announced. The winners are determined by who has the highest score for their component for that round. The points assigned to each component will not be revealed until the winner's presentation at the end of the competition. Each competitor will not know how many points were wagered by the other competitors. 
</p>
<p>
The winner of the entire competition will be determined by who has the most points from the championship round. 
</p>
<p>
Championship Tiebreaker: In the event of a tie in the Championship Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order): 
</p>
<ol>
<li>The highest cumulative component score of the components used to during the final round. </li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then by highest cumulative component score of the lesser number of components used to develop the cumulative placement score during the online qualification rounds for the tied competitors.</li> 
<li>If a tie still remains, then the prize money will be distributed equally among the tied members. </li>
</ol>
