<br><br>
Welcome to the VeriSign Sponsor Track of the 2005 TopCoder Open competition.   This competition is being sponsored in partnership with VeriSign Human Resources, VSS, VNDS and O&I's Common Application Framework(CAF)* team.   VeriSign employees are ineligible to participate in the TopCoder competition.  However, we wanted to give you the opportunity to participate and demonstrate your talents, so we have set up a special track to allow VeriSign employees to compete along side members of the TopCoder community.  We think this is an exciting event and we're glad you've chosen to participate.
<br><br>
Best of luck and let the competition begin!
<br><br>
*The Common Application Framework is a joint initiative between O&I, VNDS, VCS and VSS dedicated to developing a collection of non-application specific software components for use with Java-based online transaction processing systems. For more information about using CAF in your project, contact <A href="mailto:gbryant@verisign.com">Grady Bryant</A>.
<br><br>
The competition is free and you must be a registered TopCoder member who is at least 18 years old to be eligible. 
<br><br>
