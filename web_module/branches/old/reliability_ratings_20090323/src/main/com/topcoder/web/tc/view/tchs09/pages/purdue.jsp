                            	<p>The Department of Computer Science at Purdue University, West Lafayette was formed in 1962 and today it is recognized as one of the top computer science programs in the country.  The departmental mission is to advance the frontiers of computer science, to expand the pool of qualified individuals working in the discipline, and to reach out both within and beyond the university to apply computational principles to technical and societal problems.  Faculty in the department conduct research in all areas of computer science and in several interdisciplinary areas.</p>
								<p>The department offers the degrees of Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, and PhD in Computer Science. Currently, Purdue Computer Science has more than 400 undergraduate majors and nearly 200 graduate students working toward their degrees.  Recent new curriculum initiatives include embedded systems, software for multicore computers, a software engineering specialization, and a combined BS/MS degree.</p>								
								<p>In September 2006, the Computer Science department moved to a new home in the Richard and Patricia Lawson Computer Science Building.  The building provides students and faculty with five state-of-the-art instructional labs, four research labs, and great social settings for the computer science community.  Earlier this year the department dedicated the new Cisco TelePresence video conferencing room in the Lawson Building.  The Lawson Building is also wired with special 10-gigabit high-speed cable, 100 times faster than the standard Ethernet available throughout most of the Purdue campus.</p>
