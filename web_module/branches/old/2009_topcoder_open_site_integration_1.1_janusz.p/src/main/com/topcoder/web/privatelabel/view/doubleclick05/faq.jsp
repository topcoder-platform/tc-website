			<p><span class="dc_subTitle">Is there a way to practice before the Competition Round?</span><br/>
			Once you've registered for the DCCC, you may use your username and password to log into the competition arena.  Within the arena there is a practice area that mimics the functionality of the real competition.  Nothing that you do in the practice room will count against you.</p>

			<p><span class="dc_subTitle">What resources can I use to help me?</span><br/>
			You may utilize any reference materials, including those found on the Internet.  You may not collaborate with any other person.</p>

			<p><span class="dc_subTitle">Can I use code that has already been written as a part of my solution?</span><br/>
			Only code that has been authored by you may be used in a code submission.  No third-party source code may be used as a part of any code submission.</p>

			<p><span class="dc_subTitle">I've submitted a solution for a problem, but the time has not run out.  Can I submit again?</span><br/>
			Yes, you may resubmit.  However, remember that resubmitting carries a penalty.  Your score for that submission will be adjusted to account for the additional lapsed time since your last submission, as well as an additional penalty of 10% of the maximum point value for the problem.</p>
