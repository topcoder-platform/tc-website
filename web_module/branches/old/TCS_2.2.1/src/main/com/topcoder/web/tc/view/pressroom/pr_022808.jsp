<strong>GLASTONBURY, CONN., February 28, 2008 &#151;</strong>TopCoder&#174;, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, skills assessment and competitive software development, today announced the 49 finalists from around the world who have earned a spot in the TopCoder High School Tournament finals (finalist names and countries below). The TopCoder High School Tournament is the premier computer programming tournament for high school-aged math and science students, ages 13 to 18, enrolled in secondary schools or equivalent programs world-wide. Competition began online in December 2007, challenging math and computer science students to demonstrate their problem-solving skills by unraveling complex word problems by writing computer programs that solve the problems. TopCoder's tournament finals will bring together 49 of the most talented high school programmers from 16 countries, in quest of bragging rights, scholarships and cash prizes worth more than $50,000.

<p>
"The competitive technical nature of today's world makes it more important than ever to encourage, reward and recognize those who possess the skills to shape tomorrow's software innovations," said Marybeth Luce, vice president of Operations at TopCoder. "TopCoder's High School and College tournaments provide students from around the world with a fun and competitive learning environment to build and showcase their talent, and see how they rate compared to other top technical minds of their generation."
</p>

<p>
TopCoder High School Tournament participants are provided problems and challenges similar to those that are used in actual TopCoder competitions to build real software for many of the world's most recognized brands, such as AOL, ESPN and VeriSign. This provides an unprecedented real-world learning environment that introduces high school students to algorithm, design and development practices. The TopCoder competitions cultivate software design and development skills that are in the highest demand, showcasing individuals for college admissions and job recruitment by top employers like Eli Lilly, Deutsche Bank and the U.S. National Security Agency.
</p>

<p>
The 2008 TopCoder High School Tournament, an annual competition, will take place on March 15, 2008 at the Lawson Building on the campus of Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN, USA.
