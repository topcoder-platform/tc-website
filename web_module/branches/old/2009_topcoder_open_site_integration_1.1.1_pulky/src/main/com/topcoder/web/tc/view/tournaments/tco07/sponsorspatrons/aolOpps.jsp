For AOL, there are several advantages to Personalization, we will enable or empower our users to reach the "Long Tail" in what they are searching for, Create a sticky experience that gets people to what they want with minimum fuss, from the Advertising perspective there will be a model that will benefit from this information and offer users what they are interested in, making adverts relevant and less of a nuisance.</li>
