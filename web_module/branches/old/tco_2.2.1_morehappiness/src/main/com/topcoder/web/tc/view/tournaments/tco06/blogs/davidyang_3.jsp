Check out <tc-webtag:handle coderId="275071" darkBG="true" />’s fanatically updated TCO06 <a target="_blank" href="/?t=sponsor&c=link&link=http://web.mit.edu/huberth/www/topcoder/tco06.html">results wiki</a>.

As promised in the forums, I want to start this post with some videos that better depict the action here at the TopCoder Open.  To start, here is the much vaunted TopCoder Arena in full video glory (courtesy of YouTube):
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/7v7LVhxeJjo"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/7v7LVhxeJjo" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="600" height="350"></embed></object></div>
<br /><br />
Another vid that brings TopCoders one step closer in answering (or perhaps opens a new can of worms): just how tall is <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8357090" darkBG="true" />?
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/uAdoGVyonhs"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/uAdoGVyonhs" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="600" height="350"></embed></object></div>
<br /><br />
Because the Arena is limited to only programmers in the current round, spectators are given an outlet for their curiosity in the form of several circular displays that mimic the action on each of the competitor’s monitors.  The chatter around the monitors is definitely enlightening, as spectators’ chatter often provides the play-by-play for those of us that might not be able to understand immediately what it means when someone types "six nested FOR macros."  Here’s a sampling of some of the conversation during Round 2.
<br /><br />
Many were admiring (and fretting) over <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8357090" darkBG="true" />’s work on the problems as he quickly solved the easy problem but seemed to struggle on the medium difficulty one.  His (and other target coders monitors) are definitely the most crowded locations as people ooh-and-ahh over everything from an ingenious solution approach to how fast they can type in XEmacs.

Here’s a picture of <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10574855" darkBG="true" /> studying <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11829284" darkBG="true" />'s screen.  <tc-webta/g:handle coderId="10574855" darkBG="true" />, the victor of the first round, told me that <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11829284" darkBG="true" /> is the person that first taught him about programming over 8 or 9 years ago.  Nice work!

Another fascinating story of the TopCoder Open is brother coding team and math prodigies <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7462740" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="113178" darkBG="true" />.  Here’s Po-Ru observing his brother in action.  Po-Shen earlier admitted that Po-Ru is considerably better than him but of course, Po-Shen proved himself no lightweight either after claiming fourth place in this round.
<br /><br />
This Challenge phase started with many participants gunning for the targets as <tc-webtag:handle coderId="113178" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8365685" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="16056363" darkBG="true" /> all started by gunning for <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8357090" darkBG="true" />’s problems.  Starting in first, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="310333" darkBG="true" /> unsuccessfully challenged a problem and then had his hard problem challenged successfully to move out of the top two places with a slight 8 point deficit to <tc-webtag:handle coderId="293874" darkBG="true" />.  <tc-webtag:handle coderId="293874" darkBG="true" /> definitely defined himself as the star of this challenge round as he successfully challenged three Hard solutions (<tc-webtag:handle coderId="8357090" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="310333" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7340263" darkBG="true" />) to move himself from out of the running into a solid second place.  With 10 seconds to go, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="113178" darkBG="true" /> made a successful challenge against <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7501828" darkBG="true" /> to move into 7th.
<br /><br />
As system testing began, the top nine places (<tc-webtag:handle coderId="8355516" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="293874" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="310333" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8357090" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="16056363" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11829284" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="113178" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10599449" darkBG="true" />, and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8365685" darkBG="true" />) had all solved problems 1 and 2 with point ranges that made for a lot of possible reshuffling.  This has also left all the hard problems of the TopCoder Open unsolved.  Rounds of applause echoed as competitors 4 through 9 all solved both problems correctly but was quickly joined by a few gasps as the top three contestants failed their Medium in system test.  This took all but nicka81 out of the wildcard running.  This reshuffling left <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8357090" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="16056363" darkBG="true" /> in first and second place and moved <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11829284" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="113178" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10599449" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="293874" darkBG="true" /> spots into the wildcard positioning.
