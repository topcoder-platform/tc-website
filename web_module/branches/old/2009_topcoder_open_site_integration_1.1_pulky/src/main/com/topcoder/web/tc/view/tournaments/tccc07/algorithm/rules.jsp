                <h2>Overview of the Tournament</h2>

                <p>The 2007 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge ("Tournament") Algorithm Competition ("Algorithm Competition") will take place between July 23 and November 2, 2007. It will consist of three (3) online qualification rounds, four (4) online elimination rounds and three (3) onsite final rounds: the Semifinal, Wildcard and Championship rounds. The prize purse for the Algorithm Competition is $100,000 in cash. Up to 450 competitors will win a cash prize and up to 1,800 competitors will receive a participatory prize for competing in Online Round 1. The top 48 competitors in the online rounds will advance to the onsite Semifinal and Championship rounds held at the Contemporary Resort at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, USA, on October 31 - November 2, 2007.</p>
                
                <a name="eligibility"></a>

                <p>The format for each Qualification Round will be the same as all other Algorithm Competition rounds, and is outlined in the Competition Round Structure section.</p>
                <p>Competitors will be rated at the conclusion of their qualification attempt based on their performance against other competitors in the same round. All qualifying competitors will be assigned seeds for the Algorithm Competition based on their Algorithm rating following the Qualification Rounds.</p>
                <p>In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the Qualification Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>By reference to the competitors' ratings (higher is better) prior to the Qualification Round.</li>

                <a name="structure"></a>
                <h2>Online Elimination Rounds</h2>
                <p>Competitors in each online round must register for the round in the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than five (5) minutes prior to the start of the round. All start times will be communicated as Eastern Daylight Time (UTC/GMT -4), so contestants in different time zones must adjust accordingly. If a competitor does not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition.</p>
                <p>During tournament registration, competitors will indicate their preference regarding the section of Online Round 1 in which they wish to compete, should they advance. TopCoder will attempt to fill the sections for Online Round 1 based on indicated preference.  In the event that all indicated preferences cannot be accommodated, the preferences of competitors who registered for the tournament earlier will be given preference.</p>

                <p>All competitors in a specific section will be assigned to rooms based on 'dartboard seeding' (completely random). Each room will have a maximum of 25 competitors. The number of rooms in each round is (maximum # competitors in the round)/25.</p>

                <p>The dates and times of the online rounds of competition are as follows:</p>

                <h2>Scoring and Advancing during Online Rounds</h2>

                <p>After each section of competition in the Online Rounds, the highest scoring competitors from all rooms in the section will advance to the next online round. Competitor advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round for each competitor. In order to advance, a competitor must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater than zero) point total. The structure of the online rounds is as follows:</p>

                <h3>Online Round 1</h3>
                <p>Up to 600 competitors will compete in each section and up to 300 will advance from each section. The highest 300 scoring competitors across all rooms in each section will advance to Online Round 2.</p>
                <h3>Online Round 2</h3>
                <p>Up to 900 competitors will compete and up to 300 will advance. The highest 300 scoring competitors across all rooms will advance to Online Round 3.</p>
                <h3>Online Round 3</h3>

                <p>Up to 300 competitors will compete and up to 150 will advance. The highest 150 scoring competitors across all rooms will advance to Online Round 4.</p>

                <h3>Online Round 4</h3>
                <p>Up to 150 competitors will compete and up to 48 will advance. The highest 48 scoring competitors across all rooms will advance to the field of Semifinalists.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE</span>: In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the online rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>By reference to the total points acquired during the rounds of the Algorithm Competition in which all of the tied competitors were presented with the same set of problems (excluding the Qualification Round).  The highest score(s) advances.</li>

                        <li>If a tie still remains, then by the competitor's seed for the Algorithm Competition.</li>

                        <li>If a tie still remains, all tied competitors will advance to the next round.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                <h2>Competition Round Structure</h2>
                <p>Each online and onsite round of competition (including the Qualification Rounds) consists of three phases: Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. (Note: The format of these competition rounds is similar to the format of TopCoder Single Round Matches. The rules in place for Single Round Matches as of August 18, 2007 will also apply to the online and onsite rounds of the Tournament, with the exception of the Unused Code Rule during the onsite rounds.)</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Coding Phase</span> is a timed event in which all competitors are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and three levels of potential points. Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles.  Points are calculated on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened until the time it was submitted. During the online rounds, the Coding Phase will last 75 minutes. During the onsite rounds, the Coding Phase will last 85 minutes.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Challenge Phase</span> is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in the challenged competitor losing any points awarded for the challenged submission, and a 50-point reward for the challenging competitor. Unsuccessful challenges will reduce the challenging competitor's point total in that round of competition by 25 points. During the online rounds, the Challenge Phase will last 15 minutes. During the onsite round, the Challenge Phase will last 10 minutes.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">The System Testing Phase</span> is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The test will consist of applying a set of inputs and expecting that the output from the code submission will be correct. If the output from a competitor's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</p>
                
                <h2>Onsite Semifinal and Championship Rounds</h2>
                <h3>Important Information</h3>

                <p style="font-weight:bold;">Travel Confirmation</p>
                <p>The forty-eight (48) competitors who advance from Online Round 4 will travel to Orlando on Tuesday, October 30, 2007 to compete in the Semifinal rounds of the Tournament, held on Wednesday, October 31 and Thursday, November 1, 2007.  All onsite competitors must arrive at the Contemporary Resort no later than 2:00 PM EDT on Tuesday, October 30, 2007.</p>

                <p>All competitors must confirm their attendance at the onsite event no later than 5:00 PM EDT (UTC/GMT -4) on Friday, September 28, 2007, and must have acquired any necessary travel visas and know for certain that they can travel to the United States.  If a competitor is required to travel from outside the United States, it is necessary for the competitor to show proof of a visa and/or passport by 5:00 PM EDT (UTC/GMT -4) on Friday, September 28, 2007. Competitors may email a copy of their documents to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:jford@topcoder.com?subject=Confirmation of Attendance/Proof of Travel Documents">Jessie D'Amato Ford</a>. Competitors who fail to meet this requirement will be replaced as an onsite finalist.</p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold;">Visa Assistance</p>
                <p>At the end of Online Round 1, TopCoder will issue visa invitation letters upon the request of international competitors who may require such a letter. All competitors who advance to Online Round 1 will receive a visa invitation letter request form. Competitors have until 5:00 PM EDT (GMT/UTC -4) on Friday, September 14, 2007 to request a letter. Visas can take a significant amount of time to obtain in certain countries.  It is in the best interest of competitors who need such a letter to request one well before the deadline. The cost of obtaining a visa is the sole responsibility of the competitor. Outside of issuing an invitation letter upon request, TopCoder will not assist competitors in the process of obtaining a travel visa. See more information about <a target="_blank" href="/tc?module=Static&d1=tournaments&d2=tccc07&d3=getVisa" alt="Get travel visas">travel visas</a>.</p>

                <p style="font-weight:bold;">Travel Details</p>
                <p>TopCoder will provide air travel arrangements for each competitor. The flight will be reserved and paid for by TopCoder and will be for arrival on October 30, 2007 and departure on November 4, 2007.TopCoder will pay for each competitor's airfare up to $1,500, though we reserve the right to make exceptions to the maximum amount based on individual circumstances. Extended flights and/or hotel room nights requested by a competitor that result in additional costs will be the responsibility of the competitor.</p>

                <p>Ground transportation to and from the Orlando International Airport will be provided for each competitor by TopCoder via Disney Magical Express, and hotel accommodations and certain meals will be provided for each competitor as well. All other expenses are the responsibility of the competitor. TopCoder will not provide travel or lodging accommodations for guests of the competitor.</p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold;">Room Assignment</p>
                <p>TopCoder will determine the room assignments for the Semifinal rooms prior to the start of each Semifinal round, in the following manner:<br />
                All competitors will be arranged by their tournament seed. Starting with the highest seeded competitor and proceeding in order, a competitor will be assigned to room 1, then room 2, then room 3, then room 3 again, then room 2, then room 1. This pattern will continue (1,2,3,3,2,1) until all competitors are assigned to a room.</p>

                not already on file with TopCoder, and (iv) Travel Release. In completing the Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release, a competitor 
                who wins a cash prize (a) confirms his/her eligibility, (b) represents and warrants that he/she has not cheated; that the idea for the code and/or 
                challenge submitted is his/hers alone, (c) verifies the accuracy of the demographic information submitted to, and contained in, the TopCoder member 
                database, (d) authorizes TopCoder to publicize the Algorithm Competition's results, (e) agrees to sign any applicable forms required by tax authorities,

                and (g) releases TopCoder from liability arising out of any prize won. TopCoder requires competitors to complete the Form W-9 or W-8BEN for tax reporting 
                purposes. If prize notification is returned as undeliverable, or if the competitor who wins a cash prize fails to return the Questionnaire, Affidavit, W-9 
                or W-8BEN, or travel release, as specified, the competitor who wins the cash prize will be disqualified and the prize money will be forfeited. Providing 
                false information in the registration process or in the required forms described in this paragraph will result in a forfeiture of a cash prize.</p>
