	(a)	You may make the Program available to another individual or entity, but only subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  You must include a copy of this Agreement with each copy of the Program that you distribute to other individuals or entities.  Each additional recipient of the Program must agree to abide by the terms and conditions of this Agreement; if they do not agree to abide by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, they are not authorized to access or use the Program and you are not authorized to distribute the Program to them or to allow them to do so.<BR/><BR/>

5.	NO COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION, COMPETITION, OR CHEATING<BR/><BR/>

	This license prohibits the commercial use of the Program by any person.  The Program may not be used with or incorporated into any commercial development effort by any person.  You may not sell, rent, transfer, or resell the Program for commercial gain.  You may not use the Program or provide the Program to others for use in connection with any activity or venture, commercial or otherwise, that provides for, directly or indirectly, computer programming competitions other than TopCoder.  You may not use or modify the Program to cheat or otherwise violate the rules of any TopCoder competition or tournament.<BR/><BR/>  

6.	CONTRIBUTIONS TO TOPCODER<BR/><BR/>

	You are not obligated to provide Contributions.  If you choose to do so, this Section 6 describes the terms under which Contributions that you submit to TopCoder will be made.  Here, the term "Contribution" means modifications, changes and additions to the program provided by you to TopCoder.<BR/><BR/>

	(a)	Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you hereby grant TopCoder a non-exclusive, worldwide royalty-free license under all patent copyright, and trade secret rights licensable by you to copy, modify, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution, if any, in source code and object code form, including the right to sublicense.  This license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by you, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by such patent copyright, and trade secret rights.  The license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.<BR/><BR/>  

	(b) 	You represent and warrant that to your knowledge (i) you have all the requisite ownership rights and licenses in your Contribution, if any, to grant the license set forth in this Agreement, and (ii) your Contribution does not infringe upon or misappropriate the patent, copyright or trade secret rights of any third party.<BR/><BR/>  
	
	(c)	TopCoder values your capabilities and Contributions, and may, in its sole discretion, compensate you for any Contribution that is provided to and utilized by TopCoder.  TopCoder, in its sole discretion, will determine the appropriate amount of such compensation, and in no event will TopCoder be obligated to compensate you for any Contribution.<BR/><BR/>

7.	OWNERSHIP OF PROGRAM<BR/><BR/>

	(a) 	You acknowledge that the Program is the property of TopCoder and that you have no rights in the foregoing except those expressly granted by this Agreement.  TopCoder shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Program and TopCoder neither grants nor otherwise transfers any rights of ownership therein to you.  Nothing herein shall be construed as restricting TopCoder's right to sell, lease, license, modify, publish or otherwise distribute the Program, in whole or in part, to any person or entity throughout the world.<BR/><BR/>

	(b)	Subject to the license granted to TopCoder in Section 6(a), you shall retain all right, title and interest in and to your Contribution to the Program, if any.

8.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY<BR/><BR/>

	EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assume all risks associated with your exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<BR/><BR/>

	You understand that, although TopCoder grants the licenses to the Program set forth in this Agreement, no assurances are provided by TopCoder that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other person.  TopCoder disclaims liability to you for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.  As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses hereunder, you assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.  For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow you to use or distribute the Program, it is your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.  If you do not secure other intellectual property rights as needed or continue to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, then you must cease using, distributing or otherwise accessing the Program.<BR/><BR/>

9.	DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<BR/><BR/>

	EXCEPT FOR A BREACH OF PARAGRAPH 6(b), NEITHER YOU NOR TOPCODER SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<BR/><BR/>

10.	INABILITY TO COMPLY BECAUSE OF STATUTE OR REGULATION<BR/><BR/>

	If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement with respect to some or all of the Program due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then you must:  (a) comply with the terms of this Agreement to the maximum extent possible; and (b) when distributing the Program, describe to the recipient the limitations and the portion of the Program that such limitations affect.  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, your description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<BR/><BR/>

11.	TERMINATION<BR/><BR/>

	This Agreement will automatically terminate if you are in breach of any of its terms and conditions.  Upon termination, you agree to destroy the Program or return all copies of the Program to TopCoder along with any copies you have made to TopCoder, Inc., 703 Hebron Ave, Glastonbury, CT 06033.<BR/><BR/>

12.	EXPORT CONTROL<BR/><BR/>

	The Program may not be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, North Korea, Iran, Syria or any other country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on the U. S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders.  By downloading or using the Program, you agree to the foregoing and represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any of these countries or on any of these lists.  In addition, you agree to comply with all relevant export laws and regulations of the United States and any local laws in its jurisdiction that may impact your right to import, export or use the Program, and you represent that you have complied with any regulations or registration procedures required by applicable law to make this license enforceable.<BR/><BR/>

13.	MISCELLANEOUS<BR/><BR/>

	The terms of this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States of America, without giving effect to the principles of conflict or choice of law.  The original of this Agreement has been written in English.  You and TopCoder waive any statute, law, or regulation that might provide an alternative law or forum or to have this Agreement written in any language other than English.   You and TopCoder exclude the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act from this Agreement.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be excessively broad as to scope, activity, subject or otherwise so as to be unenforceable at law, such provision shall be constructed by limiting or reducing it so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with the applicable law as it shall then appear.  A waiver by either TopCoder or you of rights hereunder shall not be binding unless contained in a written agreement signed by an authorized representative of the party waiving its rights.  The non-enforcement or waiver of any provision on one occasion shall not constitute a waiver of such provision on any other occasions unless expressly agreed in writing.  If you have any questions concerning this Agreement, or if you desire to contact TopCoder for any reason, please send an email to TopCoder at service@topcoder.com.<BR/><BR/>

14.	ARBITRATION<BR/><BR/>

	You agree that all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration conducted in Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America, under the rules of commercial arbitration of the American Arbitration Association.  You agree to bear half of the cost of arbitration (exclusive of legal fees and expenses, which you and TopCoder shall bear separately).  All decisions of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on you and TopCoder and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of breach by you of your obligations hereunder, TopCoder may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.<BR/><BR/>

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT IT IS THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE LICENSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND TOPCODER WHICH SUPERSEDES ANY PROPOSAL OR PRIOR AGREEMENT, ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND ANY OTHER COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOU AND TOPCODER RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT.  THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE AMENDED ONLY BY A WRITING EXECUTED BY BOTH YOU AND TOPCODER.<BR/><BR/>
