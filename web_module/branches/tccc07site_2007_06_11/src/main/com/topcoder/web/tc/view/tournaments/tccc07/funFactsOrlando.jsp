            <h1><span>Fun Facts about Orlando and Disney World!</span></h1>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>According to Carlson Wagonlit Travel's 2006 Travel Trends Survey, Orlando is the second most popular domestic travel destination in the country. Las Vegas, Nevada took first place.</li>
                    <li>Out of the estimated 50 million tourists who visit Orlando each year, over 2 million are international visitors, with the majority of foreign tourists coming from the United Kingdom.</li>
                    <li>Even though few people outside of Florida knew where Orlando was before Walt Disney World opened in 1971, the city of Orlando had been around for more than century before that; it was incorporated in 1875.</li>
                    <li>The official nickname of the city of Orlando is "The City Beautiful," although it is also known as "O-Town."</li>
                    <li>Disney's Epcot has world's first geodesic sphere. It has a 150,000 square foot outside surface and an inside volume of 2,200,000 cubic feet. To hold the sphere, support pylons were driven 185 feet underground. The famous facets of the Spaceship Earth Pavilion are constructed of 11,000 triangles of alucabond, a thermal polyethaline core bonded to aluminum.</li>
                    <li>Disneyworld is the world's largest consumer of fireworks, consuming about a million shells per year. At Epcot, the nightly fireworks display fires off 1,105 individual shells, launched from 750 mortar tubes, and 56 firing modules, located at 34 positions around the lagoon. It's run by a network of 26 computers.</li>
                    <li>There's a strange, unspoken fascination with the number 14 within Disneyworld's construction. The Magic Kingdom is 14 feet above ground, the monorail is 14 miles long, and the big Tree of Life in Disney's Animal Kingdom is 14 stories tall.</li>
                    <li>The Disneyworld monorail is the world's most heavily traveled monorail, carrying 50,000,000 people a year. In fact, it has moved over 1 billion riders since it first started carrying passengers back in 1971. Since 1971, the total miles logged by Walt Disney World monorail trains would be equal to more than 30 round trips to the moon.</li>
                    <li>More than 50 million Cokes are consumed each year at Walt Disney World Resort. Guests also gobble 10 million hamburgers, 7 million hot dogs, 9 million pounds of french fries and more than 300,000 pounds of popcorn.</li>
                    <li>The Disneyworld project officially launched in 1966. In December of 1966, Walt Disney died of cancer. He never saw the park completed. In fact, the entire Disneyworld project almost died with Walt. In 1967, after a year of debate within the company, Walt's brother Roy Disney decided to move forward with the project plans.</li>
