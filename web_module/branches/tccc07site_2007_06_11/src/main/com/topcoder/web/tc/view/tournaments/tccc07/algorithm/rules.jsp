                <h2>Overview of the Tournament</h2>
                <p>The 2007 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge ("Tournament") Algorithm Competition ("Algorithm Competition") will take place between July 23 and November 2, 2007. It will consist of three (3) online qualification rounds, four (4) online elimination rounds and three (3) onsite final rounds: the Semifinal, Wildcard and Championship rounds. The prize purse for the Algorithm Competition is $100,000 in cash. Up to 450 competitors will win a cash prize and up to 1,800 competitors will receive a participatory prize for competing in Online Round #1. The top 48 competitors in the online rounds will advance to the onsite Semifinal and Championship rounds, held at the Contemporary Resort at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, USA,on October 31 - November 2, 2007.</p>
                
                <h2>Eligibility</h2>

Residents of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria are ineligible to receive cash prizes and are ineligible to attend the onsite semi-final round of competition as competitors.</p>
                <p>Employees of TopCoder, Inc. and of all Tournament sponsors, regardless of commitment date as sponsor, including any companies involved in the production (including prize suppliers), implementation and distribution of the Tournament and their advertising or promotion agencies, parent companies, service providers, agents, officers, subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other persons or entities directly associated with the Tournament and members of their immediate families (parent, child, sibling, and spouse of each) and/or persons living in the same household as such persons, are ineligible to participate in the Tournament. If a competitor's employer signs on as an official sponsor of the Tournament after July 23, 2007, then that competitor will be removed from further participation in the tournament. TopCoder members who are performing internships for any Tournament sponsor between July 23 and November 2, 2007 are also ineligible to participate.</p>
                <p>Those members who are eligible to compete in any of the four Tournament competitions will be permitted to participate in any/all of them online. However, in the event a member becomes a finalist in more than one competition and the onsite competition times overlap, the member must choose only one competition in which to participate as a finalist by September 28, 2007.</p>
                <p>In the event that a competitor is disqualified from any round, no other competitors will be added in his/her place. The only exception to this is advancement to the onsite rounds.</p>
                
                <h2>Registration</h2>

                <p>The format for each Qualification Round will be the same as all other Algorithm Competition rounds, and is outlined in the Competition Round Structure section.</p>
                <p>Competitors will be rated at the conclusion of their qualification attempt based on their performance against other competitors in the same round. All qualifying competitors will be assigned seeds for the Algorithm Competition based on their Algorithm rating following the Qualification Rounds.</p>
                <p>In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the Qualification Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>By reference to the competitors' ratings (higher is better) prior to the Qualification Round.</li>
                        <li>If a tie still remains, all tied competitors will advance to Online Round #1.</li>
                    </ol>

                <h2>Online Elimination Rounds</h2>
                <p>Competitors in each online round must register for the round in the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than five (5) minutes prior to the start of the round. All start times will be communicated as Eastern Daylight Time (UTC/GMT -4), so contestants in different time zones must adjust accordingly. If a competitor does not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition.</p>
                <p>All competitors who have qualified for an online round will indicate the section of the round in which they wish to compete. During tournament registration competitors will indicate their preferences regarding Online Round #1. TopCoder will attempt to fill the sections for Online Round #1 based on indicated preference.  In the event that all indicated preferences cannot be accommodated, the preferences of competitors who registered for the tournament earlier will be given preference.</p>
                <p>All competitors in a specific section will be assigned to rooms based on 'dartboard seeding' (completely random). Each room will have a maximum of 25 competitors. The number of rooms in each round is (maximum # competitors in the round)/25.</p>
                <p>The dates and times of the online rounds of competition are as follows:</p>

                <h2>Scoring and Advancing during Online Rounds</h2>
                <p>After each section of competition in the Online Rounds, the highest scoring competitors from all rooms in the section will advance to the next online round. Competitor advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round for each competitor. In order to advance, a competitor must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater than zero) point total. The structure of the online rounds is as follows:</p>
                <h3>Online Round #1</h3>
                <p>Up to 600 competitors will compete in each section and up to 300 will advance from each section. The highest 300 scoring competitors across all rooms in each section will advance to Online Round #2.</p>
                <h3>Online Round #2</h3>
                <p>Up to 900 competitors will compete and up to 300 will advance. The highest 300 scoring competitors across all rooms will advance to Online Round #3.</p>
                <h3>Online Round #3</h3>
                <p>Up to 300 competitors will compete and up to 150 will advance. The highest 150 scoring competitors across all rooms will advance to Online Round #4.</p>
                <h3>Online Round #4</h3>
                <p>Up to 150 competitors will compete and up to 48 will advance. The highest 48 scoring competitors across all rooms will advance to the field of Semifinalists.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE</span>: In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the online rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>By reference to the total points acquired during the rounds of the Algorithm Competition in which all of the tied competitors were presented with the same set of problems (excluding the Qualification Round).  The highest score(s) advances.</li>
                        <li>If a tie still remains, then by the competitor's seed for the Algorithm Competition.</li>
                        <li>If a tie still remains, all tied competitors will advance to the next round.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                <h2>Competition Round Structure</h2>
                <p>Each online and onsite round of competition (including the Qualification Rounds) consists of three phases: Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. (Note: The format of these competition rounds is similar to the format of TopCoder Single Round Matches. The rules in place for Single Round Matches as of August 18, 2007 will also apply to the online and onsite rounds of the Tournament, with the exception of the Unused Code Rule during the onsite rounds.)</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Coding Phase</span> is a timed event in which all competitors are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of potential points. Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles.  Points are calculated on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened until the time it was submitted. During the online rounds, the Coding Phase will last 75 minutes. During the onsite rounds, the Coding Phase will last 85 minutes.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Challenge Phase</span> is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in the challenged competitor losing any points awarded for the challenged submission, and a 50-point reward for the challenging competitor. Unsuccessful challenges will reduce the challenging competitor's point total in that round of competition by 25 points. During the online rounds, the Challenge Phase will last 15 minutes. During the onsite round, the Challenge Phase will last 10 minutes.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">The System Testing Phase</span> is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The test will consist of applying a set of inputs and expecting that the output from the code submission will be correct. If the output from a competitor's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</p>
