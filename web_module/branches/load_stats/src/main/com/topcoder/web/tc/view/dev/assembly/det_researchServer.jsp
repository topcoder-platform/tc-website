<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
The Research Server application is one half of an application; the Research Project application. It's an application server based on a Service Oriented Architecture and leveraging Microsoft's Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). The entire Research Project application will allow users to perform searches on a database of Nielsen television ratings data by specifying complex search criteria. The results of these searches are displayed to the user in the windows forms application on rich sortable grids. In addition, the application allows the user to save search criteria as a set, send results to a printer or email, and run pre-packaged standalone reports. The majority of the business logic is provided by the components used by this system. The Research Server application will provide access to the underlying business logic and data of the application. In addition, it will handle low level administration tasks such as logging, unified exception handling, configuration management, and object management.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
The purpose of this competition is to provide access to the business logic provided in separate components of the Research Project application. The finished application will provide access to each of the components' public methods, and handle all instances of object creation, configuration, and disposal. An example of this is the "Research Search Service" component. This component has a dependency on the "Named Query" processor component. The Research Server component will be responsible for instantiating an instance of the Research Search Service object on each request, and assigning it's "QueryProcessor" property from a saved Named Query Processor instance. Exact details of component dependencies and object lifecycles are described in the accompanying documentation.
<br><br>
In addition to object management, the provided application will leverage the given Extended Exception Management Application Block (EEMAB), and wrap all errors with the appropriate wrapper exception and user message. 
<br><br>
The competition will also provide adapters for the connection factory, data access interface, and logging wrapper component that must interact with the provided third party libraries. These adapters will allow generic components such as the Named Query Processor to interact with these libraries without any external modifications.
