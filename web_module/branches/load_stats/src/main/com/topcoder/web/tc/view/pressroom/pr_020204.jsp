<p><span class="bodyTitle">TopCoder Announces DoubleClick 2004 Coding Challenge</span><br />
<span class="bodySubTitle"><em>Marketing tools leader to host TopCoder-powered programming competition for employees and NYC students</em></span></p>
</div>

<p><strong>GLASTONBURY, Conn., February 2, 2004&#151;</strong>
TopCoder, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, skills assessment and competitive software development, announced DoubleClick Inc. has engaged the company to conduct a programming competition beginning today, February 2. DoubleClick, the leading provider of marketing tools for advertisers, direct marketers and web publishers, is using the challenge to cultivate the competitive spirit and the technical strength of their software engineers and of the students at Columbia University and New York University.  The results will show the relative skills of participants in the analysis of complex algorithmic problems and their ability to write software to solve those problems.</p>

<p>Having self-administered coding competitions for its employees for the last two years, DoubleClick is now turning to TopCoder to expand this year's competition to include external applicants.  The DoubleClick 2004 Coding Challenge is open to all DoubleClick employees worldwide.  As an added dimension this year, DoubleClick is also opening the challenge to students at two local universities - Columbia and NYU.  While they won't be competing for the same prizes, the employees and students will be asked to solve the same sets of complex algorithmic problems during two rounds of competitions.  Participants will have the choice of using Java, C++, C# or VB.Net to compete.  For more information and registration, go to <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/doubleclick">www.topcoder.com/doubleclick</a>.</p>

<p>"TopCoder's challenge platform is a perfect vehicle for DoubleClick to showcase the technical strength of our development staff, as well as promote the technology leadership of the company throughout college campuses," said Mok Choe, Chief Information Officer, DoubleClick.  "We look forward to being a part of this dual effort."</p>

<p>DoubleClick will entice competitors from both groups by giving away impressive prizes to the finalists.  The student champion will take home $5,000 in cash, while the employee champion will win a Sony 32" Plasma TV.  Additional cash prizes of $5,000, Garmin iQue 3600 Palm devices, Canon PowerShot S400 digital cameras and Apple iPods will be awarded to the remaining finalists.  The combination of top-notch prizes and the excitement of competition provides incentive for a diverse, skilled group of programmers to participate.</p>

<p>"TopCoder's private label events are an innovative idea - the platform provides companies with a way to engage targeted audiences, in this case employees and local students, in a stimulating competition," said Rob Hughes, President of TopCoder.  "We are excited to bring this pioneering program to another leading technology company who understands the importance of showcasing solid programming talent."</p>
