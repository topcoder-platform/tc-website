<span class="bigTitle">Instrumentation Reporting</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
Instrumentation Reporting is a web based diagnostic tool that provides reporting and troubleshooting information for developers and business personnel.  The information collected by the framework is crucial for Events Correlation, Monitoring, and Reporting.  When leveraged appropriately, these key areas contribute in reducing operational costs and increasing productivity and customer satisfaction.  For example:
<ul>
<li>Development and support personnel can identify errors within any application, component, and method across a web farm resulting in quicker turnaround for known issues.</li>
<li>Support personnel can monitor key resources such as servers and components to forecast potential bottlenecks resulting in system failure.</li>
<li>Business groups can run trend reports on specific client applications, client channels, and client id's to track usage over a specific period of time.</li>
<li>Business groups can track frequently used functionality and performance times.</li>
</ul>

Instrumentation Reporting is built against a framework that provides a complete end to end systems management solution.  The basis of the framework is to log events for all system and application components using the framework.  An event can be classified as either error, admin, trace, audit, call enter, and call return  The logging is built upon Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and records all these events to a SQL Server 2005 database.  
<br><br>
Instrumentation Reporting will be used by a TopCoder client. All application documentation (including an assembly guide) will be available once registered. 
<br><br>
<span class="bigRed">NOTE: Please see the eligibility requirements below. Competitors must sign a non-disclosure agreement and pass a background check before being admitted into this competition.   If you have previously completed these documents, no further action is needed.</span>
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
This assembly competition will consist of component integration and extensive unit testing to ensure correct operation.  The majority of the application will be implemented by generic TopCoder components.  The main task will involve configuring these components, writing UI code, writing a deployment guide, and packaging the application for deployment.  
<br><br>
* The application html prototype will be "pre-converted" to aspx pages to help get you started. However, these pages will still require modifications as your UI code is implemented.
<br><br>
* A sample database will be provided containing data for the application.
