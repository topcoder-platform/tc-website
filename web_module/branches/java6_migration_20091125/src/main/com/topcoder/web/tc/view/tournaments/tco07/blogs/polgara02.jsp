                        <p><strong>Day 1: Wednesday</strong></p>
<p>The DRW booth is so hot it&rsquo;s cool (English is such a strange language). They have comfy seats, a chess set, good-looking people manning the booth and of course a Nintendo Wii. So what is it like having a booth next to them?</p>
<p>Well, it sucks. Here&rsquo;s the typical scenario:</p>
<p>[Attendee walks towards the Ball booth, eager to learn about our game (note: use of the word &ldquo;eager&rdquo; may be ever-so-slightly exaggerated).]</p>
<p>Attendee: Hi Sarah, tell me what is the ball?</p>
<p>Sarah: Glad you asked, the ball is an online scavenger hunt where&hellip;..</p>
<p>Attendee: Woa, a Wii&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>[Attendee walks to DRW booth]</p>
<p>Sarah: ah, okay - bye [sad voice, fading in the distance]</p>
<p><strong>Day 2: Thursday</strong></p>
<p>When you can&rsquo;t beat them, join them (or accidentally stand near the DRW booth with an open flame and hope that all that hotness will spontaneously combust).</p>
<p>Since there is no way to compete (do you like how I stuck that TopCoder buzz word in there?) with the DRW booth, I am now going to piggy-back off their traffic. Instead of waiting for attendees to come to our booth, I&rsquo;m going to take advantage of the captive audience at the DRW booth who are ripe for receiving clue sheets and other Ball pitches.</p>
<p>Success Value: Mixed &ndash; effective with targeting people sitting on the comfy chairs or lining up waiting for the Wii. Not so effective with people actually playing the Wii &ndash; something about them needing their hands to actually play.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>On to AOL:</strong></p>
<p>Magnet (or mgnet): AOL has this really cool application in development that pulls up pictures instead of traditional text links when you do a keyword search. So if you were searching for something like: &ldquo;Thunder&rdquo;, &ldquo;Down-Under&rdquo; by the old-fashioned way of searching, you would get back a bunch of links some of which would be about lightning storms over Sydney. Using the new AOL tool pulls back pictures instead of links, so you can immediately zero-in on the important links (like the ads you'll see all over Vegas promoting the revue of semi-clad Australian men).</p>
<p>This blog entry is now longer than the other two admin blogs from <tc-webtag:handle coderId="279551"/> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="14999860"/> - since I am now winning that competition, will sign-off for now. </p>
