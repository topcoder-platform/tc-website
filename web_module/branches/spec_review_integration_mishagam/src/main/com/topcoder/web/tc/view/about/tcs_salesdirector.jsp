                        <p>Competition is the driving force behind TopCoder.  What started as simply trying to identify the world's best technical talent became a re-engineering of the entire software development process. <strong>We are now looking to build the best sales team in the business</strong> - a team that is passionate about innovations in technology, building relationships with customers, and with the desire to be a part of a thriving, entrepreneurial and rapidly growing company.  Our sales team plays a critical role in defining, creating and executing a strategy to penetrate the world's leading companies to provide technology solutions to drive their businesses.

                            <li>Immediately begin development of a sales pipeline and creation of a business plan including specific target accounts and strategies to exceed revenue goals.</li>
                            <li>Balance aggressively identifying potential revenue-generating prospects with developing long-lasting, relationship-based business partnerships that benefit both parties.</li>
                            <li>Visualize and articulate innovative ways TopCoder can have a direct, beneficial impact on a prospect's business.</li>
                            <li>Think outside of the "cold-call the CIO" box.</li>
                            <li>Utilize strong research and networking skills critical for pipeline/account development.</li>
                            <li>Demonstrate interest in exploring the latest technology trends and gadgets.</li>
                            <li>Utilize social networking tools like LinkedIn/Facebook/blogs/forums etc.</li>
                            <li>Travel frequently. This position can be based anywhere in the US.</li>

                            <li>Demonstrated strong selling skills or an aptitude for identifying/closing business opportunities.</li>
                            <li>A basic understanding of software development - although the ability to discuss social networking, crowdsourcing and other "Web 2.0" concepts would suffice.</li>
                            <li>Candidates must be US Citizens, have a valid Greencard, or be eligible for a TN visa.</li>
                        </ul>
