Each contest posted in <a href="/tc?module=ViewActiveContests&amp;ph=112">Software Design</a> and <a href="/tc?module=ViewArchitectureActiveContests">Software Architecture</a> will carry a point value.  <a href="/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=digital_run&amp;d2=2008v2&amp;d3=desOverview">Placement Points</a> will be awarded based on the number of submissions that pass review. By registering for any design competition or software architecture competition, a competitor agrees to the items outlined on each project's Project Overview page, including the Eligibility requirements and the Terms of Work, and the completion of all paperwork required by TopCoder.

TopCoder reserves the right to cancel, terminate or modify this program if it is not capable of completion as planned for any reason, including infection by computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention or technical failures of any sort. TopCoder reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change any aspects of the component design competitions, software architecture competitions and the Design Cup, including but not limited to, these rules, the software methodology, the scorecard, the prize purse and the point distribution schedule, at any point during this program. TopCoder makes no guarantee as to the number of competitions that are open for competition in any particular development language for each weekly competition. Teams are NOT allowed for any competition. Collusion between members to submit work that is not their own is expressly forbidden by these rules and the Terms of Work.
