              TopCoder members from all over the country will be participating
              in this event, but <B><I>all start times will be communicated as

              All competitors who have registered for the online tournament 
              round will be assigned to a specific tournament room.  
              TopCoder will perform the room assignments prior to the start of 
              a tournament round, in a manner such that only coders in the same 
              division are placed in a room and the average competitor 
              rating for each room is similar.  
              The Online Round will begin at

            Each online tournament round consists of three phases:
            the coding phase, challenge phase, and the testing phase.
          </LI>

                                                <B>The Coding Phase</B> is a timed event where all
              contestants are presented with the same three questions representing
              three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels
              of point earnings potential.
              Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of
              any solution that successfully compiles.
            </LI>
                                            <LI>
                                                <B>The Challenge Phase</B> is a timed event wherein each competitor
              has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code.
              A successful challenge will award 50 points to the challenger, and any 
              points gained by the submitter for the problem will be lost. 
              Unsuccessful challenges will cost the challenger 50 points as a
              penalty, applied to their total score in that round of competition.
            </LI>
                                            <LI>
                                                <B>The Automated Testing Phase</B> is applied to all submitted code that has
              not already been successfully challenged.  If TopCoder finds code that is flawed,
              the author of that code submission will lose all of the points they earned for that
              code submission.  The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output
              from the code submission to be correct.  If the output from a coder's submission does 
              not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed.  The same set of input/output 
              test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem.

                                            <BR/>
The prize winners of each room will be determined as follows:  Coder standing in each room is determined by comparing the point values for all coders in the room for all three phases of the round.  Those with the top three positive point values in the room, place in first, second, and third.  In the event of a tie (unlikely, since scoring is calculated to .01), all coders who have greater than zero points tied for a place will split that prize money combined with the prize money of lesser place(s) equal to the number of coders tied.  For example:  if three coders within a room are tied for first place with positive point totals, they split the combined prize money for first, second and third place.  No other coders are paid.  If two coders are tied for first place with positive point totals, they split the first and second prize money combined, and the coder with the next highest positive point total wins the third place prize money.
            <BR/>
                                            <BR/>
            All contestants, who opened any problem during the round, will have their ratings 
            adjusted up or down to reflect their performance, based on TopCoder's rating formula.  
            Contestant ratings play no role in a Coder's final standing in the competition room.

        and returned to TopCoder.  Prizes will be presented within 10 days of making an eligibility 
        determination. Unclaimed or undeliverable prizes will not be awarded.<BR/>
