<p><strong>GLASTONBURY, Conn., October 14, 2003&#151;</strong>

that Talbots, a large clothing and specialty retailer, has subscribed to the TopCoder Software .NET Component Catalog (<A href="http://www.topcodersoftware.com">www.topcodersoftware.com</A>).

efficiently.</p>

<p>TopCoder Software's .NET and Java Component Catalogs include more than 90 re-usable software components.  Through TopCoder Software's

development resource to create software and provide programming services for our customers," said David Tanacea, president of TopCoder Software.

software components at a very low cost."</p>
