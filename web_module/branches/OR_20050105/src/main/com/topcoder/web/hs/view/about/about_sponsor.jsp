                        <h3>Sponsors</h3>

                        <p>TopCoder High School provides sponsoring companies the ability to proactively and directly support and
                        promote high school math and science programs within their communities.  It also allows companies to reach a
                        desirable and targeted market of high school consumers and their families.  Sponsorship of these academically
                        competitive events may further position a company as a leader in the community and provide benefit to those
                        students who previously had no "playing field" to showcase their skills.</p>

                        <p>Three sponsorship packages are available to companies. The investment and benefits of each package are as
                        follows:</p>
