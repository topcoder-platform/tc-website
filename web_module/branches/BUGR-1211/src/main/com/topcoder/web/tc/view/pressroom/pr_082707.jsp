<span class="bodySubTitle"><em>TopCoder Ranks No.45 on the 2007 Inc. 500 With Three-Year Sales Growth of 2,459.4%</em></span></p>
</div>
      
<p><strong>Glastonbury, Conn., August 27, 2007 &#151;</strong>TopCoder&#174;, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, skills assessment and competitive software development, today announced it has been named to the Inc. 500 list of the fastest-growing private companies in America. Inc. magazine today released its annual Inc. 500 in which TopCoder is ranked No. 45 on the list, with three-year sales growth of 2,459.4%. The 2007 Inc. 500 can be found in the magazine's September issue.</p>

<p>The Inc. 500 ranks privately held companies according to year-over-year sales growth from 2003 to 2006. With approximately 75% of all new job creation in the U.S. coming from entrepreneurial businesses, the Inc. 500 opens a window onto the companies and industries that are driving the economy forward. Over the years, the Inc. 500 has identified the next generation of world-class companies, with Microsoft, Stonyfield Farms, Timberland, Oracle, The Princeton Review, Morningstar, Jamba Juice, Gateway, E*Trade, Intuit, and Domino's Pizza all appearing on the list before they became industry powerhouses.</p>

<p>"To be recognized in this year's INC 500 list is high recognition of the ingenuity, effort and determination exemplified by the entire TopCoder organization," said Rob Hughes, President and COO of TopCoder, Inc.  "TopCoder's commitment to the power of Community and performance on a global level is the engine which will drive our continued growth and success in the years ahead."</p>

<p>The companies that made this list represent the vanguard of American industry, posting an average three-year sales growth of 939%. Inc. 500 companies posted aggregate 2006 revenue of $16 billion, and a median revenue of $10.5 million.</p>

<p><span class="bodySubtitle">How the 2007 Inc. 500 Were Selected</span><br />
