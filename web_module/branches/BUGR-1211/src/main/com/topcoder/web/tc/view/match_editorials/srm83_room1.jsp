<span class="bigTitle">Room 1 Review</span>

<P>Room 1 started with everyone opening the Level One problem, except <A HREF="/stat?c=last_match" CLASS="bodyGeneric">dmwright</A> 
who skipped to the Level Two and <A HREF="/stat?c=last_match" CLASS="bodyGeneric">reid</A> who did start with the Level One, but 
for some reason started five minutes late. Meanwhile, <A HREF="/stat?c=last_match" CLASS="bodyGeneric">ZorbaTHut</A> had finished 
and submitted the Level One problem in only seconds more than three and a half minutes, getting 196.90 points. 
<A HREF="/stat?c=last_match" CLASS="bodyGeneric">SnapDragon</A> and <A HREF="/stat?c=last_match" CLASS="bodyGeneric">doeth</A> 
submitted theirs in four and a half minutes for 195.07 and 195.15 points respectively, followed by the rest of Room One 
(except <B>dmwright</B>), each coder proceeding to the Level Two problem.</P>

<P><B>doeth</B> submitted the Level Two problem both fast and best, getting 418.77 points for 17 minutes of work, while <B>dmwright</B> 
finished his solution, taking almost 27 minutes for 333.96 points and going back to the Level One problem, finishing it in 6 minutes 
for 192.60 points.</P>

<P>In a surprise move, <A HREF="/stat?c=last_match" CLASS="bodyGeneric">benetin</A> apparently gave up on the Level Two problem, moving 
on to the Level Three problem after almost 18 minutes of work. Meanwhile, <A HREF="/stat?c=last_match" CLASS="bodyGeneric">Joe</A>, 
<A HREF="/stat?c=last_match" CLASS="bodyGeneric">John Dethridge</A>, <B>reid</B>, and finally <B>ZorbaTHut</B> submitted their Level Two 
solutions within ten minutes, <B>Joe</B> getting 340.62 points due to a late start and <B>ZorbaTHut</B> bringing up the end with only 278.27 points, taking
him 37 minutes.</P>

<P>Aside from <A HREF="/stat?c=last_match" CLASS="bodyGeneric">derkuci's</A> late Level Two submission, only half a minute before the 
end of coding phase, getting 206.07 points for almost 70 minutes of work, all that was left were the Level Three submissions. <B>reid</B> 
scored dramatically higher than anyone else, submitting in under 16 minutes and getting 787.79 points. <B>dmwright</B> took half an hour and 
got 552.89 points, while <B>doeth</B> spent 48 minutes for 429.12 points.</P>

<P>At the end of coding phase, <B>reid</B> was comfortably in the lead by almost 250 points, followed by <B>dmwright</B> and <B>doeth</B> 
seperated by a mere 20 points, but <B>Snapdragon</B>, <B>Joe</B>, and <B>John Dethridge</B> 
behind them by over 500.</P>

<P>Challenge phase started with the only Level Three challenge attempted, <B>doeth's</B> unsuccessful challenge on <B>dmwright</B>. All 
the other challenges were on the Level Two problem, with <B>Joe</B>, <B>doeth</B>, and <B>dmwright's</B> solutions falling to <B>John Dethridge</B>, 
<B>benetin</B>, and <B>SnapDragon</B> respectively. <B>SnapDragon</B> also challenged <B>doeth's</B> Level Two unsuccessfully, and <B>benetin</B> 
attacked <B>SnapDragon</B> and <B>ZorbaTHut's</B> solutions unsuccessfully.</P>

<P>Despite <B>dmwright</B> and <B>doeth</B> losing their Level Two submission, both of them were still in the same positions after challenge phase. 
Systest produced no changes, only shuffling around 5th through 7th place, as <B>ZorbaTHut</B>, <B>SnapDragon</B>, and <B>derkuci's</B> Level Two 
solutions all failed. <B>ZorbaTHut</B> ended up in 5th place on the strength of his Level One solution with <B>benetin</B> picking up last due to 
a very slow submission (over 9 minutes, for 180.71 points.)</P>

<P><B>reid</B>, the only coder in Room One with all three submissions still intact, won by a margin of over 570 points, boosting his rating by 137 
points. <B>dmwright</B> and <B>doeth</B> picked up second and third place, <B>doeth</B> increasing by 32 points and <B>dmwright</B>, due to his 
exceedingly high rating after the collegiate and the exceptional performance by <B>reid</B>, actually dropping by 8 rating points.</P>

<P><B>benetin</B> picked up last, his Level One submission combined with a net loss of 50 points in challenge phase only giving him 130.71 points, 
losing him 183 rating points.</P>

<P><B>John Dethridge</B> was 4th by only 22 points despite a successful challenge by him and an unsuccessful by <B>doeth</B>.</P>
