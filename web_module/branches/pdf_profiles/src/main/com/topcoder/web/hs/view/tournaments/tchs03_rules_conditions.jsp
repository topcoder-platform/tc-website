                        <p>Contestants must not cheat. All ideas for any code and/or challenge submitted must be the contestant's alone.</p>

                        <p>Winners in each round of competition will be those competitors who win the most points in their respective 
                        rooms. All decisions relating to the viability of submissions, the ranking of submissions and all other matters 
                        pertaining to the tournament shall be within the sole discretion of TopCoder or its designee and shall be final and 
                        binding in all respects.</p>

                        officers, employees, representatives and agents, from and against any and all liability for any loss, property damage 
                        or damage to person, including without limitation, death and injury, due in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, 
                        from or arising out of participation in this tournament, or participation in any tournament-related activity, or the 
                        receipt, use or misuse of a prize. TopCoder specifically disclaims all liability associated with, and makes no

                        this tournament, and to take any other action it deems appropriate, for no reason or any reason whatsoever, 
                        including if TopCoder suspects competitors of cheating, tampering with the entry process, the operation of the Web 
                        site, or the tournament process, or otherwise being in violation of the rules. TopCoder reserves the right to cancel,
