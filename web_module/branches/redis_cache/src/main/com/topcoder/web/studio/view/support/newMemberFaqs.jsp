                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_1-1"><strong>What kind of competitions will I find here?</strong></a><br />
                        Studio holds competitions for many areas of graphic design and web design/development. From logo challenges, web design, print and apparel -  to Flash, Flex 3, JavaScript and widget design, you're sure to find an outlet for your creativity. Competitions are currently posted in two ways: 1) Studio-managed challenges which are held by clients who use Studio information architects and other resources to manage their challenges, and 2) TopCoder Direct-managed challenges which are managed completely by clients.
                        </a></p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_1-2"><strong>Who are the clients?</strong></a><br />
                        Clients range from Fortune 500 corporations who need new GUI for their applications to small businesses and start-ups looking for a new logo. Clients like AOL, ESPN, LendingTree, and GEICO regularly seek fresh ideas and unique concepts through Studio competitions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_1-3"><strong>How much are the prize purses?</strong></a><br />
                        Prizes vary according to what the client wants to pay, the type of project and the amount of work involved. You'll see simple icon or banner challenges listed for a couple hundred dollars, while prototypes and widget builds may go for a couple of thousand dollars. High profile challenges can go for even more!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_1-4"><strong>Is it true that you hold live tournaments?</strong></a><br />
                        Yes. TopCoder holds an annual on-site tournament in the spring/summer. Studio is just one of the "tracks" at this large tournament. During the first few months of the year, Studio holds online rounds that allow designers a chance to qualify for the finals. During the 2008 TopCoder Open, twelve Studio finalists competed during the week of May 12, 2008 in Las Vegas for a total prize purse of $45,000. The champion won the grand prize of $20,000. <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tournaments&d2=tco08&d3=studio&d4=summary"> See more details about TCO08 here</a>.

                        <a name="QA_1-5"><strong>Are there other benefits to competing in Studio?</strong></a><br />
                        In addition to the prize purse that is awarded for each competition, competitors also have the chance to earn Studio Cup points. The Studio cup is a monthly bonus prize pool that is distributed to the top performers in any given month. Along with bonus money, the winner each month wins a free trip to the 2009 TopCoder Open in Las Vegas. <a href="http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=Static&d1=digitalrun&d2=2008v2&d3=home">Learn more about the Studio Cup here</a>.

                        <a name="QA_2-1"><strong>Where do I register?</strong></a><br />
                        Studio is part of <a href="http://topcoder.com">TopCoder, Inc.</a> All registrations for TopCoder and Studio go through the same portal, so when you get to the registration screen, it's important to check the Studio box as the type of registration you want when you become a TopCoder member.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_2-2"><strong>OK, I am registered. How do I compete?</strong></a><br />
                        Any visitor to Studio can view challenge details. However, in order to compete, you must be a TopCoder member and you must do the following:<br />
                        Register for the challenge you wish to enter. In order to view and download any supporting documentation for a challenge, you must register for that specific challenge. Registering does not mean you are obligated to compete.
                        Sign and return your Assignment Document. All members must complete and return a standard assignment document before competing for the first time. You only need to do this once. <a href="#QA_3-1">More information about the assignment document can be found here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_2-3"><strong>What if I have questions while I am creating my design?</strong></a><br />
                        Each challenge has detailed information within the challenge details that you should follow. If you can't find your answers there, you can visit that challenge's forum and ask questions. Your fellow members, Studio admins and the client will do their best to help clarify anything you need.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_2-4"><strong>I'm ready to submit! How do I do that?</strong></a><br />
                        Studio competitions require all members to upload both their submission files (the files we display on the Studio site and present to the client) and their source files (the files that are transferred to the client only if you win a prize). The current system requires you to submit three files (preview image, submission files and source files)  [You can find more information about how to format your submission here]. (link to submission area of this FAQS)
                        </p>

                        <a name="QA_2-5"><strong>I submitted my design. Now what happens?</strong></a><br />
                        All designs go through an initial screening phase. Submissions are screened against any requirements the client has specified and any copyright infringement or cheating. You will receive an email notification about your submission's status once it has been screened. If you submit early enough in a challenge, and your submission fails screening, you have the opportunity to resubmit before the challenge ends. Once final screening is completed, the client can make their winner selection(s).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_2-6"><strong>Hey, I won! How do I get paid?</strong></a><br />
                        In order to get paid, you must submit an IRS tax form. You will also choose how you would like to get paid (wire transfer, check or PayPal). All challenge payments are scheduled and posted to your Payments page on TopCoder within 7 days of winning a challenge. Your payment is then sent the following month, [within the schedule outlined at the bottom of this linked help file]. (link to payment schedule table in this FAQS)
                        </p>

                        <h3>Assignment Questions</h3>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_3-1"><strong>What is the Assignment Document?</strong></a><br />
                        This document is simply a confirmation of a member's agreement to transfer ownership of a winning entry to TopCoder, so that the member may receive payment for their work. 
                        The Assignment Document does NOT assign any entries for which you are not compensated, and you still retain the ownership of such entries. 
                        There is, however, a license included in the Assignment Document that allows TopCoder to display any/all of your submissions on the web site, in order that the client(s) may view submissions and select winners. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_3-2"><strong>Where is the Assignment Document?</strong></a><br />

                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_3-3"><strong>Why does the Assignment Document also include my future winning entries?</strong></a><br />
                        We have set up the Assignment Document to cover future entries for two reasons. First, having the Assignment Document cover future entries reduces the amount of paperwork for members and TopCoder. Second, it also relieves members from having to go through this process for each challenge.

                        You should sign and return the Assignment Document immediately after registering for your first Studio challenge. We must receive and process your signed Assignment Document before you will be able to upload any work to the Studio website. It can take up to one full business day to process your Assignment Document. See the processing timeline table (below) to determine when you should send your Assignment Document.
                        Also, you may send your Assignment Document to us even before your register for a competition.

                        Your submission cannot contain any stock art unless the challenge details specifically allow it. The majority of challenges on Studio only allow you to submit designs that you have created yourself. Please be sure you understand the Terms and check each challenge for more information about copyright issues before you submit.

                        Your submission cannot contain any artwork or code that is labeled "free" or is in the public domain unless the challenge specifically allows it.

                        <a name="QA_4-3"><strong>Can I include screenshots or photos from the web as long as I somehow show that they are placeholders?</strong></a><br />
                        You should never "grab" screenshots or photos from the web or stock art sites to use as placeholders. You can, however, use images the client provides for that challenge. Otherwise, please create your own placeholder images.
                        </p>

                        Yes, as long as you are not violating any licensing laws with regard to photo releases (taking photos of people and selling/distributing them without their knowledge and written consent, taking photos of objects or places that have restrictions on photography, etc.)

                        If you are concerned that your submission will fail, you should explain your concerns in the challenge forum and/or send an email to the Studio admins. When it doubt, read the challenge details again and look for any restrictions or allowances for copyrighted materials. Most challenges will only allow you to submit designs you have created yourself.

                        If a client provides the images, you are free to use them. If, however, a client asks you to take images from the web that you or the client do not own, you should contact Studio admins so that we can help the client revise their requirements.

                        <a name="QA_5-1"><strong>How many submissions can I upload to a challenge?</strong></a><br />
                        You may upload as many submissions as you like, however, each challenge limits how many submissions from each member will be eligible for consideration by the client. (See next question). This is why you will rank your submissions as you upload them, or after you've uploaded. 
                        </p>

                        <a name="QA_5-2"><strong>How many of my submissions will be considered for a challenge?</strong></a><br />
                        Each challenge will outline how many of each member's submissions will be eligible to be considered for prizes. Most challenges will limit the number of submissions that will be considered from each member. However, a few challenges will have no such limit. It is very important to note how many of your submissions are eligible when you enter. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_5-3"><strong>When can I rank my submissions?</strong></a><br />
                        You have the opportunity to rank your submissions when you upload them. You can change the rank of your submissions at any time before the submission phase ends. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_5-4"><strong>What happens if I don't rank my submissions?</strong></a><br />
                        By default, your submissions will be ranked in reverse of the order in which they were uploaded. So, your most recent submission is assumed to be your most preferred. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_5-5"><strong>I made changes to a submission I've already uploaded. Can I replace the old submission with my new submission?</strong></a><br />
                        Yes. When you upload your new submission, you will be able to view all of your previous submissions. Just remove the old submission and rank your new submission accordingly. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_5-6"><strong>Why is my submission screened?</strong></a><br />
                        The screening process is in place to ensure that all submissions meet the specification's minimum requirements (if there are any listed) and to identify submissions with copyright infringement problems or submitters who are cheating. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_5-7"><strong>Can I fix my submission if it fails screening?</strong></a><br />
                        - Before the submission deadline: Yes. If you submit early enough in the challenge, your submission is likely to get screened before the submission deadline. If your submission fails, you have the opportunity to fix problems and resubmit.
                        - After the deadline: No. A failed submission cannot be revised and reconsidered for a challenge after the deadline. All screening decisions are final. Studio encourages you to submit as early as possible so that you can fix any problems if your submission fails screening before the challenge deadline.
                        </p>

                        <a name="QA_5-8"><strong>When will final screening be complete?</strong></a><br />
                        The majority of challenges go through a final screening by Studio admins within 12 hours after the submission phase deadline. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <a name="QA_5-9"><strong>What is included in my submission?</strong></a><br />
                        Your entire challenge submission will include three elements: <br />
                        Your display submission file(s): The file(s) you include in this Zip file will be displayed on the Studio site. The client will see everything within this Zip file and will base their winner choices on what they see here.
                        <br />Your final source file(s): The file(s) you include in this Zip file will never be displayed on the Studio site. This Zip file is only transferred to the client if your submission receives a prize placement.
                        <br />Your preview image: The file you choose here represents your entire submission and is the first thing a client sees when evaluating your submission. It is turned into a thumbnail and displayed on the Studio site. Some challenges have specific requirements for Preview images - please be sure to read the challenge specification thoroughly.

                        <a name="QA_5-1O"><strong>Why must I submit my source files with my submission?</strong></a><br />
                        When a client chooses a winner, Studio transfers the source files to the client. Source files are only released from the submissions that have won a prize placement. 
                        </p>

                        <a name="QA_5-11"><strong>Will my source files be shown on the Studio web site?</strong></a><br />
                        No. When you submit to a challenge, your source files are not shown on the Studio web site. We only show your submission files. If your submission wins a prize placement, the IP rights of your source files will transfer to the client.  
                        </p>

                        Your submission Zip file will be created based on the information you find on the challenge Details page.

                        Your source Zip file will be created based on the information you find on the challenge Details page. 
                        Here are some examples: 
                        <strong>XYZ Logo challenge</strong><br />
                        All vector files of the submitted logo design, created as IA files and/or EPS files. All fonts used (with the exception of Windows standard fonts) in your design must also be submitted in this zip. If you do not have permission to release the fonts, you must provide a text file including the name of the font and a link to where the font can be purchased.
                        <strong>XYZ Web Design Storyboard challenge</strong><br /> 
                        All original source files of the submitted design. Files should be created in Adobe Photoshop, Gimp, Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape and saved as layered PSD files, AI or EPS files.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        All fonts used (with the exception of Windows standard fonts) in your design must also be submitted in this zip. If you do not have permission to release the fonts, you must provide a text file including the name of the font and a link to where the font can be purchased.

                        Same as "submission" folder PLUS any additional files for new graphics created. New files should be created in Adobe Photoshop, Gimp, Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape and saved as layered PSD files, AI or EPS files. All fonts used (with the exception of Windows standard fonts) in your design must also be submitted in this zip. If you do not have permission to release the fonts, you must provide a text file including the name of the font and a link to where the font can be purchased.

                         <img src="/i/v2/sub_process3.gif" alt="Preview Image" /><br />
                        Your preview image can be one of your JPG files from your submission files if the challenge is graphical, or it can be a screenshot of one of the pages/screens your have programmed in coding challenges. Some challenges have specific requirements for Preview images - please be sure to read the challenge specification thoroughly.
                        </p>

                        <a name="QA_5-15"><strong>When should I submit?</strong></a><br />
                        Because some internet connections are slow, and some source files are very large, we recommend uploading a "test" submission 24 hours before the challenge ends. This will allow you to understand how long it will take your submission to be accepted. Once you've finalized your design, you can replace your test submission with your final one.
                        </p>

                        At the conclusion of each challenge, after the client has made winner selections, the challenge Administrator will notify winners via email with instructions on how to get paid. This notification will arrive within 7 days of winner designation.

                        TopCoder begins the payment process for Studio challenges one business day after the final files for the challenge have been delivered by the winner(s).

                        Payments of $25.00 or more are distributed on the 15th day of the following month. For example: a payment earned between January 1st and January 31st will be released on February 15. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
