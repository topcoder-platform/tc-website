<h3>The Event</h3>

<p>
    TopCoder is sponsoring an online software development competition at ${mainEvent.school.name} for
    components posted from ${startDateFormatted} through ${endDateFormatted}. 
</p>

<p>
    Registration for this event will be open from <tc-webtag:format object="${event.registrationStart}" format=" MMMMM d, yyyy 'at' hh:mm a z" timeZone="${mainEvent.timeZone.description}"/>
     through <tc-webtag:format object="${event.registrationEnd}" format=" MMMMM d, yyyy 'at' hh:mm a z" timeZone="${mainEvent.timeZone.description}"/>.
    
   
</p>

<p>
    The event will take place over the course of ${weeks } weeks and will include all components posted from
     ${startDateFormatted} through ${endDateFormatted}. In addition to <a href="/reg/">registering with TopCoder</a>, all competitors must
    <a href="/tc?module=CollegeTourViewReg FIXME">register for this competition</A>.
</p>

<h3>Competition Overview</h3>
<p>
    Registered competitors have the opportunity to participate in component design and development
    competitions at TopCoder. To get a feel for the projects available in this competition, or if you're ready to start competing, 
    take a look at the <A href="/tc?module=ViewActiveContests&ph=112">available design projects</A> and the 
    <A href="/tc?module=ViewActiveContests&ph=113">available development projects</A>.
    Scoring in the Series is determined based on the placement for each submission, as it relates to
    other ${mainEvent.school.name} submissions. Placement is determined based on the score awarded for a
    particular component. For example, if 3 submissions were received for a component and the scores
    were 93, 89, and 71, the competitor receiving the score of 93 would be in 1st place and would
    receive 10 points. Note that only those registered for the event from ${mainEvent.school.name} are
    considered when determining place and placement points. In order to receive placement points, a
    submission must pass the minimum component score of 75. Placement scoring is as follows:
</p>

<p align="center">
    <strong>1st Place - 10 Points</strong><br />
    <strong>2nd Place - 7 Points</strong><br />
    <strong>3rd Place - 5 points</strong><br />
    <strong>4th Place - 4 Points</strong><br />
    <strong>Below 4th Place - 0 Points</strong><br />
</p>

<p>
    During each week of competition, eligible competitors can submit design and/or development solutions
    for at least one eligible component by the submission deadline. Submissions will be scored by the
    TopCoder Review Boards and will be subject to final review and appeal in the same manner as standard
    component design and development submissions. Scoring of each submission by the TopCoder Review
    Boards is based on the criteria outlined in the Development Review Scorecard for the Development
    Challenge or the criteria outlined in the Design Review Scorecard for the Design Challenge. Note that
    the scorecards to be used for the series are the ones that are in effect as of 
<tc-webtag:format object="${startDate}" format=" MMMMM d, yyyy"/>. ALL
    SUBMISSIONS MUST BE RECEIVED ACCORDING TO THE SUBMISSION DEADLINE TO BE CONSIDERED A VIABLE ENTRY.
    THERE WILL BE NO EXCEPTIONS.
</p>

<p>
    In the event of a tie of cumulative placement score for the Weekly or Series Prizes, the tie will be
    resolved in the following manner:

    <ul>
        <li>Highest individual component score of the lesser number of components used to develop the cumulative
            placement score for the tied competitors.
        </li>
        <li>If a tie still remains, then all tied contestants will share equally in the prize money.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

    <h3>Prizes</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Participatory Prize:</strong> All competitors who pass review at least once during the ${weeks} weeks will receive
    a
    TopCoder t-shirt. Each competitor is only allowed to win a maximum of one t-shirt.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Weekly Prize:</strong> The three competitors with the highest weekly placement points will win the following
    cash prizes:
</p>

    <ul>
        <c:set var="i" value="1"/>
        <c:forEach items="${weeklyPrizes}" var="prizeAmount">

            <c:set var="i" value="${i+1 }"/>
        </c:forEach>
    </ul>
<p>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Competitors must submit a submission that <strong>passes review</strong> to be eligible to win a Weekly Prize.
</p>

        <c:forEach items="${overallPrizes}" var="prizeAmount">
