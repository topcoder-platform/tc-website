                        <p>The DRW presentation has become another highlight today, at least judging
                        by the finalists' reports. It is not a big secret that sponsor presentations
                        sometimes get a little boring and 'business-like', and <a href="/tc?module=Static&d1=tournaments&d2=tco07&d3=sponsorspatrons&d4=drw">DRW</a> has managed to
                        avoid that mistake completely. <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11829284" context="algorithm"/> has named the absence of a single
                        PowerPoint slide as the compelling indicator of the entire DRW attitude.
                        DRW has employed a demo trading application to say what others would have
                        said using long, long phrases. And they were rewarded by the finalists
                        taking real interest in the presentation -- about fifty questions were asked
                        and answered providing some interesting discussion about DRW's work.</p>
                        
                        <p>The DRW booth has also attracted a lot of attention, as DRW people provided
                        the competitors with a Wii videogame, and have organized a long-awaited poker 
                        tournament today.</p>
                        
                        <p><div align=center><img src="/i/tournament/tco07/onsitePhotos/038.jpg"></div><br /></p>
                        
                        <p>Together with the successful presentation, that means
                        DRW people have managed to tune right into the spirit of the TCO - 
                        the spirit of competition and fun. Good job! We're hoping to see DRW
                        sponsoring future TopCoder tournaments. :)</p>
