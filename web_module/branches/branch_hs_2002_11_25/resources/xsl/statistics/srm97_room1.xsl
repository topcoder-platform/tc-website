<P><B>Single Round Match 97</B><BR/>
June 12, 2002</P>
<P><B>Room 1 Review</B></P>

<P>
Room One today saw the usual quick start by most of the room on the Level
One problem. <B>ZorbaTHut</B>, <B>SnapDragon</B>, <B>Yarin</B>, <B>dgarthur</B>, <B>malpt</B>, and <B>DjinnKahn</B>
opened the Level One within seconds of the round's start. <B>John Dethridge</B> and
<B>reid</B> started late, both opening at approximately the three-minute mark.
<B>venco</B> broke with tradition and opened the Level Three first.
</P>

<P>
First submission went to <B>Yarin</B>, turning in his Level One in a little over
nine minutes for 317.70 points. <B>Yarin</B> was quickly followed by <B>SnapDragon</B>,
then <B>ZorbaTHut</B>, the last earning 314.79 points. As usual, the late starts
messed things up a little. Despite submitting a minute and a half later,
<B>John Dethridge</B> got the fastest submission in the room, earning 325.37 points
for slightly under eight minutes of work, <B>reid</B> spending only twenty seconds
more for 323.70 points. Curiously enough, while almost all the programmers
finished in less than ten and a half minutes of work, <B>malpt</B>, <B>dgarthur</B>, and
<B>DjinnKahn</B> spent over thirteen and a half minutes each, yet came within
twenty seconds of each other, earning under 290 points.  Each coder
proceeded to the Level Two except <B>John Dethridge</B>, who skipped ahead to the
Level Three.
</P>

<P>
And speaking of the Level Three, <B>venco</B> finished up his Level Three
submission after only 21:39, earning 750.13 points then dropping back to
start the Level One. <B>John Dethridge</B> finished his Level Three before any
coder finished the grueling Level Two problem, 768.56 points on 20 minutes
of work, and dropped to the Level Two after a short break.
</P>

<P>
First submission on the Level Two came from <B>Yarin</B> as well, spending 22:43
for 299.21 points, but once again his score was beaten by a late started.
<B>reid</B> took the high score on the Level Two, barely more than 19 minutes of
work yielding 325.62 points. Most of the coders finished less than 30
minutes after starting, <B>DjinnKahn</B> coming within 30 seconds of the border,
earning from 289 points to 259 points on the low end. <B>dgarthur</B> apparently
ran into some trouble, taking more than ten minutes longer than <B>DjinnKahn</B>,
only earning 218.17 points. Each coder proceeded on to the Level Three.
</P>

<P>
<B>reid</B> was the first to complete the problem set, spending under 16 minutes on
the Level Three, getting 861.66 points for his solution. <B>SnapDragon</B> finished
second, needing 17:38 for 825.82 points. <B>DjinnKahn</B> spent pver 22 minutes for
737.13 points and was quickly topped by <B>dgarthur</B>'s 883.14 point solution,
coded in under 15 minutes. <B>malpt</B> took 28 minutes, submitting 4 minutes
before the end of the match for 650.12 points, followed by <B>ZorbaTHut</B>'s
solution, ten minutes longer and 110 points weaker. <B>venco</B>, meanwhile,
finished up his Level Two solution, only earning 221.86 points on it. <B>Yarin</B>
was the only one to not submit all three problems.
</P>

<P>
After coding phase, <B>reid</B> had a clear lead with 1510.98 points, <B>SnapDragon</B>
falling behind by almost 100 points, followed rapidly by <B>dgarthur</B> and <B>John Dethridge</B>, either of them in a position to take 2nd place by a single
challenge. <B>ZorbaTHut</B> took the lowest place among the coders who had
completed the set, <B>Yarin</B> taking last overall.
</P>

<P>
Challenge phase would bring its set of changes, though. <B>venco</B> rapidly
challenged <B>dgarthur</B>'s Level One solution, pushing him two places up - one
place from <B>dgarthur</B>'s fall, and one place for passing <B>DjinnKahn</B>, who was
literally a single point ahead beforehand. Unfortunately for <B>dgarthur</B>, his
Level Two was flawed as well, which <B>Yarin</B> used to increase his score.
Unfortunately for <B>Yarin</B>, <B>dgarthur</B>'s Level Three alone was worth more than
both of <B>Yarin</B>'s submissions, even with the challenge included.
</P>

<P>
An unusually interesting challenge round was followed by unusually damaging
system tests. Four problems failed overall. <B>dgarthur</B>'s Level Three turned
out to be flawed as well, dropping <B>dgarthur</B> to a devastating zero total
points. <B>malpt</B>'s Level Three had a bug, known to <B>malpt</B> even before challenge
phase, as he admitted afterwards. <B>ZorbaTHut</B> and <B>DjinnKahn</B> both lost their
Level Two submissions as well.
</P>

<P>
<B>reid</B>, on the other hand, kept all his submissions, gaining 89 rating points
to become the third coder to break 3000. <B>SnapDragon</B>'s submissions survived
as well, propelling him to within 12 points of the 3000 barrier. <B>John Dethridge</B> took third, increasing his rating to 2905, while <B>venco</B>'s rating
increased 94 points, the most in the room. <B>venco</B>'s final score of 1333.20,
including his challenge, would have been sufficient to easily win any other
room.
</P>

<P>
<B>DjinnKahn</B> only finished with 1024.95 points, and while his final score was
beaten by <B>radeye</B> in room 2, he would have won any room from 3rd on. His
rating increased by 86. <B>ZorbaTHut</B>'s near-first and near-3000 dropped by 15
points, still well within reach of 3000, though not within reach of <B>reid</B>.
<B>Yarin</B> lost 20 points, and <B>malpt</B> 29. <B>dgarthur</B>, not surprisingly, lost his
maximum in one round, a painful 191 rating points.
</P>
