	      The match will feature a mixed programming language format. For each individual problem, the coder will have the option of using either Java or C++ to code the solution. Syntactical knowledge of both languages will be helpful during the challenge phase of each round of competition.<BR><BR><B>Divisions and Ironman Room Assignments:</B><UL><LI>Members rated 1200 or better compete in Division-I</LI><LI>Members rated 1199 or lower compete in Division-II</LI></UL><UL><LI><B>When to start the Online Tournament Rounds</B><BR>
TopCoder members must register for each single round match from within the competition arena. 
              Registration is for 1.5 hours before the start of each match.
              To register, login to the Tournament Arena applet, click on the 'Main' menu, and 
              choose the option for 'Event Registration'.
              TopCoder members from all over the world will be participating
              in this event, but <B><I>all start times will be communicated as 
              &nbsp;Eastern Standard Time, so contestants in different time zones must 
              adjust accordingly.</I></B>  
              All competitors who have registered for the match 
               will be assigned to a specific competition room.  
              TopCoder will perform the room assignments prior to the start of 
              a competition round, in a manner such that only coders in the same 
              division are placed in a room and the average competitor 
              rating for each room is similar. The start time will vary from match to match, so be sure to check the <A CLASS="bodyText" HREF="?module=Static&d1=schedule&d2=schedule">calendar</A> for
              the starting times of each match.            
            
            <BR></LI><BR><BR><LI><B>Upon Entering an Online Tournament Round</B><BR>
            Each online tournament round consists of three phases:
            the coding phase, challenge phase, and the testing phase.
          </LI><OL><LI><B>The Coding Phase</B> is a timed event where all
              contestants are presented with the same three questions representing
              three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels
              of point earnings potential.
              Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of
              any solution that successfully compiles.
            </LI><LI><B>The Challenge Phase</B> is a timed event wherein each competitor
              has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code.
              A successful challenge will award 50 points to the challenger, and any 
              points gained by the submitter for the problem will be lost. 
              Unsuccessful challenges will cost the challenger 50 points as a
              penalty, applied to their total score in that round of competition.
            </LI><LI><B>The Automated Testing Phase</B> is applied to all submitted code that has
              not already been successfully challenged.  If TopCoder finds code that is flawed,
              the author of that code submission will lose all of the points they earned for that
              code submission.  The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output
              from the code submission to be correct.  If the output from a coder's submission does 
              not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed.  The same set of input/output 
              test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem.
            </LI></OL><BR><LI><B>Scoring during Online Tournament Rounds</B><BR>
            All contestants, who opened any problem during the round, will have their ratings 
            adjusted up or down to reflect their performance, based on TopCoder's rating formula.  
            Contestant ratings play no role in a Coder's final standing in the competition room.
          </LI></UL><BR><B>Conditions of Participation</B><BR>
