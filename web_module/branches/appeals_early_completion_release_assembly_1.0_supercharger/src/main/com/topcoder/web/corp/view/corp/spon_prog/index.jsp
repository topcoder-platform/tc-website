                        TopCoder has created an online venue that brings together some of the most talented developers
                        from around the world.  Each week, TopCoder hosts an online programming competition (Single Round Match)
                        during which developers compete for ratings and bragging rights, and to hone their skills for our
                        large <a href="/corp/?module=Static&d1=corp&d2=spon_prog&d3=market_tourny">tournaments</a>.</p>

                        TopCoder competitions offer a venue previously unavailable to the programming world - real-time competitions
                        that are judged immediately and objectively.  With TopCoder, technologists
                        from around the world are able to compete online in a short and concentrated amount of time.  Moreover,
                        with each weekly Single Round Match lasting only 90-minutes, programmers don't have to sacrifice as much
                        free time to compete and have the chance to compete more often.</p>
