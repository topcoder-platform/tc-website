         <span class="dc_subTitle">About the Tournament</span>
         <br><br>
         <span class="dc_subTitle">Use of Plugins in the Competition Arena</span><br>
         The use of external TopCoder Arena plugins or any modifications to the Competition Arena functionality is strictly prohibited.
         <br><br>
         <span class="dc_subTitle">Logging in Tournament</span><br>
         In order to compete in the tournament, registrants must log in to the Competition Arena no later than ten minutes prior to the start of the round.  
         <br><br>
         <span class="dc_subTitle">Scoring</span><br>
         After the results of the competition have been compiled, the top five overall scorers will be identified and will be awarded a grand prize, and in each region the top 10% of finishers will be awarded a prize.  Each participant must have positive (i.e., greater than zero) points to win a prize, so if there are less than five participants who score positive points, only those participants with a positive point total will win grand prizes.  Similarly, participants must score positive points to qualify for a prize as a regional winner. Participant placement is determined by aggregating the total point values from all three phases of the round for each participant. 
         <br><br>
         <span class="dc_subTitle">Competition Round Structure</span><br>
         The round of competition consists of three phases: the Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. 
         <ul>
         <li>The <strong>Coding Phase</strong> is a timed event where all participants are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.</li>
         <li>The <strong>Challenge Phase</strong> is a timed event wherein each participant has a chance to challenge the functionality of other participants' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the points originally attributed to the defendant for the code submission points, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition. </li>
         <li>The <strong>System Testing Phase</strong> is a series of automated tests applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a participant's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the global set of test cases that are used to test all submitted code in the System Testing Phase.</li>
         </ul>
         <span class="dc_subTitle">Competition Round</span><br>
         All registered employees will compete in the competition round being held online on Wednesday, March 2 at 11:00AM ET.  
         <br><br>
         All registered DoubleClick employees will be eligible to compete in the competition round.  Participants will be randomly assigned to specific virtual rooms, with up to 10 people in each room.  TopCoder will determine room assignments prior to the start of the competition round.  The participant with the highest point value in the competition round will be declared the first place winner.  
         <br><br>
         <a name="prizes"></a>
         <span class="dc_subTitle">About the Prizes</span><br>
         All participants who compete in the competition round will receive a DoubleClick 2005 Coding Challenge T-shirt and a personally engraved memento.  In addition, the top five scorers overall will win grand prizes, and the remaining top 10% of finishers in each region will win prizes.  For example, if there are 50 participants in a given region, the top five finishers in that region who did not receive a grand prize will receive a prize.  If a region has less than 10 participants, the top finisher in that region will still receive a prize, provided he/she did not win a grand prize. DoubleClick will pay all applicable taxes on prizes.  Prizes will be distributed as described here.
