         <span class="greenSubtitle">Summary of the Tournament</span><br>
         The Google&#153; India Code Jam 2005 (GICJ05) is being offered by Google Online India Private Limited ("Google") and TopCoder, Inc. ("TopCoder").  Google is using the results of the GICJ05 to identify possible employees for Google's Research & Development Center in Bangalore, India.  The GICJ05 will take place between Tuesday, February 8 and Saturday, March 26, 2005.  It begins with an 18-day online registration, after which all registered individuals will participate in a Qualification Round to determine who will compete in the programming tournament.  The tournament consists of one (1) qualification round, one (1) online elimination round and one (1) onsite final round.  In addition, Google will award Rs. 16,00,000 in cash prizes to the 50 finalists in the tournament.
         <br><br>
         <strong>Eligibility</strong><br>
         All individuals who are residents of India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore and Thailand may register and compete in the Google India Code Jam 2005.  
         <br><br>
         Registrants who are 18 years of age or older are eligible to win cash prizes, unless otherwise prohibited. The Google India Code Jam 2005 is void where prohibited by applicable law.
         <br><br>
         Employees of Google and TopCoder and those involved in the production (including prize suppliers), implementation and distribution of this tournament and their advertising or promotion agencies, contractors, parent companies, agents, officers, subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other persons or entities directly associated with the tournament and members of the immediate families and/or persons living in the same household as such persons, are ineligible to enter the tournament.
         <br><br>
         <strong>Registration</strong><br>
         Registration will open on Tuesday, February 8 at 9:00AM IST and will close on Friday, February 25 at 6:00PM IST.  Registration is unlimited, however each individual may only register once.
         <br><br>
         <strong>Competition Round Structure</strong><br>
         Each online and onsite round of competition (excluding the Qualification Round) consists of three phases: the Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. The Qualification Round will consist only of the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase.  (See "Qualification Round" above for details regarding the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase of the Qualification Round.)

         <ul>         
         <li>The Coding Phase is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.</li>
         <li>The Challenge Phase is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.</li>
         <li>The System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</li>
         </ul>

         <strong>Qualification Round</strong><br>
         The Qualification Round will be open for 12 hours from 9:00AM through 9:00PM IST on Sunday, February 27, 2005.
         <br><br>
         The Qualification Round will consist of two phases: the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase.
         <ul>
         <li><strong>The Qualification Round Coding Phase</strong> is a timed event where contestants are presented with a randomly generated problem set. Each problem set contains two questions representing two levels of complexity and, accordingly, two levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted. Competitors will have 60 minutes to complete either or both of the problems. The 60 minutes will begin to elapse once the first problem is opened. The timer in the coding window will count down to the end of the 60 minutes. A competitor who begins the qualification attempt within the final 60 minutes of the Qualification Round will have less than 60 minutes to attempt qualification.</li>
         <li><strong>The Qualification Round System Testing Phase</strong> is applied to all submitted code after the conclusion of the Qualification Round Coding Phase. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given question. </li>
         </ul>
         The top 500 positive (i.e., greater than zero) scorers from the problem sets presented during the Qualification Round will be eligible to compete in Round 1 of the GICJ05. 
         <br><br>
         <strong>The Competition Field</strong><br>
         Up to 500 individuals will qualify to compete in Round 1.  The top 50 scorers from Round 1 will advance to the Championship Round, which will be held onsite at or near Google's office in Bangalore, India.
         <br><br>
         The Rounds will be held on the following dates:

         <strong>Use of Plugins in the Competition Arena</strong>
         The use of external TopCoder Arena plugins or any modifications to the TopCoder Arena functionality is strictly prohibited.
         <br><br>
         <strong>Online Elimination Round</strong><br>
         Everyone who competes in Round 1 must log in to the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than ten minutes prior to the start of the online round.  All start times will be communicated as India Standard Time, so contestants in other time zones must adjust accordingly.  If a coder does not participate, for any reason, in the online round, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition. 
         <br><br>
         All competitors who have been invited to compete will be randomly assigned to specific rooms, with up to 10 people in each room.  TopCoder will determine all room assignments prior to the start of each online round. 
         <br><br>
         <strong>Scoring and Advancing</strong><br>
         After each round of competition, the top scorers will be identified and will advance to the next round.  Coder advancement is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round (see Competition Round Structure) for each coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater-than-zero) point total. The structure of the online rounds is as follows:
         <br><br>
         <strong>Round 1 (online)</strong><br>
         <ul>
         <li>Up to 500 coders will compete in Round 1 and up to 50 will advance.  The 50 highest scoring competitors will advance to the Championship Round.  Each coder must have positive points to advance, so if there are less than 50 competitors who score positive points, only those competitors with a positive point total will advance.</li>
         </ul>
         <strong>NOTE:</strong>  In the event of a tie for any advancing position, all tied coders will advance to the Championship Round.
         <br><br>
         <strong>Onsite Championship Round</strong><br>
         The 50 advancers from Round 1 will travel to Bangalore, India on Friday, March 25 to compete in the Championship Round of the tournament being held on Saturday, March 26, 2005.  Each finalist must confirm his/her attendance in the Championship Round by March 11, 2005.  If a contestant does not confirm his/her attendance in the Championship Round by said date, he/she will forfeit eligibility to receive a prize, and his/her spot in the tournament will be given to the next highest scorer from Round 1.
         <br><br>
         Google will provide all travel accommodations for each finalist to attend the Championship Round.  In addition, Google will provide overnight accommodations and all travel arrangements to and from the airport if required, as well as transportation to the contest venue and all meals for the participants.  All other expenses are the responsibility of the contestant.   
         <br><br>
         TopCoder will determine the room assignments for the Championship Round prior to the start of the Championship Round. 
         <br><br>
         The Championship Round will be a single round of 50 coders. The placement of finishers in the Championship Round is determined by comparing the total points of each coder, with the highest point value placing first. The winner of the Championship Round will be the coder with the highest point total for the round. In the event of a tie in the Championship Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order):

         <ul>
         <li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during online Round 1</li>
         <li>If a tie still remains in the Championship Round, then the prize money will be distributed equally among the tied coders</li>
         </ul>

         <a name="prizes"></a>
         <span class="greenSubtitle">About the Prizes</span><br>
         The 50 finalists in the Championship Round will receive cash prizes totaling Rs. 16,00,000.  As required by Indian law, Google India will deduct income-tax at source from all prize money, at the rate of 30% + surcharge + educational cess.  Prizes will be distributed as follows:
