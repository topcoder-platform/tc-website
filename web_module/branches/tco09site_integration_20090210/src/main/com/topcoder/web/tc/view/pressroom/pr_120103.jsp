   the TopCoder Charity Challenge, sponsored by the AT&amp;T Foundation, Benefiting the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation (CRPF) (<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/crpf">www.topcoder.com/crpf</a>).  
   As a result of this unique tournament, CRPF raised nearly $40,000.</p>
   
   <p>This programming tournament, the first event of its kind, awarded 10 grand prizes.  Four grand prizes were awarded to the fundraisers who raised the most 
   donations for CRPF.  In addition, four grand prizes were awarded to the highest point scorers in the tournament.  Two additional grand prizes were given to 
   eligible winners of a drawing.  The grand prizewinners received an all expenses paid trip to attend A Magical Evening, the annual star-studded gala for the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation.</p>
   
   <p>Cristobal Baray and his wife, Catherine, from Sunnyvale, California were the number one and two fundraisers, respectively, in this tournament.  Jared Showalter was the leading point scorer in the tournament. These winners were in for a special treat as Christopher Reeve made his first public appearance without the use of his ventilator.</p>
   
   <p>John Lithgow opened the fundraising gala and presented the Visionary Leadership Award to acclaimed architect and designer, Michael Graves while Dana Reeve presented the Human Spirit Award to Francine LeFrak and Rick Friedberg.  Paula Zahn introduced the evening's entertainment, a performance by Wade Preston of the Tony-award winning Broadway musical, Movin' Out. Other celebrities in attendance included Joan Collins, Diane Sawyer, Mike Nichols, David Blaine, Buzz Aldrin, Patty Hearst Shaw and Bernard Shaw.</p>
