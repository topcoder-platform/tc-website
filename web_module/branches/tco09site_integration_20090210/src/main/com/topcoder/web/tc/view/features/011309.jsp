<p><strong>What brought you to TopCoder?</strong><br />
My classmates.</p>

<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month?</strong><br />
It's unbelievable. I never thought I could be the Coder of the Month. I think I'm so lucky and I will try my best to be better.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
Sports like basketball, football, tennis, swimming. Also mathematics and history.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
When I do something, I'm more efficient and faster.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tomms/2846907419/">This photo</a> really sets the tone for Toronto this time of year.</p>
<p><strong>What brought you to TopCoder?</strong><br />
I will answer this in two stages:<br />
What brought me to TopCoder is the need to compete :) I love competitions and TopCoder is the best competition engine around.<br />
What keeps me with TopCoder is the awesome community, the great competition I get from them, and the fact that TopCoder makes a good thing better no matter what the circumstances are. This is a growing, living, thing :)  It makes me alive... I currently cannot imagine life without TopCoder... and also puts some really good money in the community's pockets :)
</p>

<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month?</strong><br />
It is an amazing feeling. There are so many great competitors that being chosen as the design of the month is a great honor.  December is especially dear to me since I had a number of problems competing and there were just such great competitors around!  So that made it doubly hard :) <br />
Kudos goes to <tc-webtag:handle coderId="20437508" context="design" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="287614" context="design" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="14820574" context="design" />, and the other competitors who push the envelope and thus push me as well.
</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
There are a number of hobbies that I try to divide my time evenly around with occasional spurts of dedicated activity.  I like to write short stories (especially science-fiction) and would like to get published one day, and I also started doing music again (after a year or so hiatus). I am currently concentrating on acoustic guitar.  I also do daily stock trading and analysis (nothing special) and these days it is quite a wild experience!  Apart from that I would say it would be sports.  And if I have time, I like to watch a good movie... but time is kind of scarce now :)
</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
TopCoder has forced me to be more organized. When you have serious competition you have to take all things seriously and by nature I am not a serious person. TopCoder has also made me very appreciative of organized efforts.  I primarily do design competitions and I have to support them during development and I really appreciate more and more of all people's input into the process (which TopCoder has made so seamless). Without the architect I would have no designs to make, and without the developers I would not learn how the design really faired. And without the assemblers it would not be integrated... and without TopCoder there would be none of it :)

<p><strong>What brought you to TopCoder?</strong><br />
My classmate introduced the TopCoder to me and I think joining it is the best way to improve my skills.</p>

<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Coder of the Month?</strong><br />
Very surprised and excited. I feel lucky to be chosen as the coder of this month.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides TopCoder?</strong><br />
I like playing soccer and watching soccer match since my childhood. It brings me perseverance and a lot of happiness.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at TopCoder that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
Value your time and work efficiently. I think it is the most important thing what I learned in TopCoder.

2) Location : Small Town of Pulu Raja, subdistrict of Pulau Rakyat, Regency of Asahan, Province of North Sumatera , Indonesia. This is the backyard of my home with watermelon ( mmm, yummy :-p ) plants shattered around between an old dead palm oil tree,that sometimes in the night me and my friends sneak around to take our parts. :-D.</em></p>

<p><strong>What brought you to Studio?</strong><br />
One day, I read on my local newspaper about <tc-webtag:handle coderId="22689218" /> winning at the 2007 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge. I then searched all about TopCoder on Google, and took my step on Studio where my journey began. :-).
</p>

<p><strong>How does it feel to be the Designer of the Month?</strong><br />
Surprised of course, it was my lucky month :-P.<br />
It makes me realize there's too much that I don't know yet.
</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite hobby besides Studio?</strong><br />
Watching movies, playing pc games, reading, playing futsal.
</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing that you have learned at Studio that has helped you in other areas of your life?</strong><br />
Always give your best works anytime everywhere, never give up, and be a fighter of your own life. :-)
