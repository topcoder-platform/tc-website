            </a>Registration</h3>
			Registration for the 2005 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge Algorithm Competition will open at 9:00AM EST on Monday, December 20, 2004, and will close at 9:00AM EST on Tuesday, January 11, 2005.  In order to be eligible to compete in the Algorithm Competition, competitors must be a registered TopCoder member and have registered separately for the Algorithm Competition.  Registration for the competition is unlimited, however each individual may only register once.
			<br/><br/>
            <a name="qualification"></a>
			<span class=bodySubtitle>Qualification Round - 12:00PM EST Tuesday, January 11 - 12:00PM EST Wednesday, January 12, 2005</span>
			<br/><br/>
			The Qualification Round will be open for 24 hours from 12:00PM EST Tuesday, January 11 through 12:00PM EST Wednesday, January 12, 2005.  Each competitor may participate in the Qualification Round at any time during the 24 hours.  Competitors may only attempt to qualify one time during the 24 hours.
			<br/><br/>
			The Qualification Round will consist of only two phases: the Coding Phase and System Testing Phase.<br/>
			<b>Note: The Qualification Round will not include a Challenge Phase.</b>

			<ul>
			<li>The Qualification Round Coding Phase is a timed event where contestants are randomly presented with one of five possible problem sets.  Each problem set contains two questions representing two levels of complexity and, accordingly, two levels of point earnings potential. Points for a question are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the question was opened to the time it was submitted.  Competitors will have 60 minutes to complete either or both of the problems.  The 60 minutes will begin to elapse once the first problem is opened.  The timer in the coding window will count down to the end of the 60 minutes.  A competitor who begins the qualification attempt within the final 60 minutes of the Qualification Round will have less than 60 minutes to attempt qualification.</li>
			<li>The Qualification Round System Testing Phase is applied to all submitted code at the conclusion of the Qualification Round. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given question.</li>
			</ul>

			Upon logging in to the TopCoder Arena during the Qualification Round, each competitor who has registered for the Algorithm Competition will receive a message indicating which set of problems he/she has been assigned.  The highest 100 positive (i.e., greater than zero) scorers from each of the five problem sets presented during the Qualification Round will be eligible to compete in Online Round #1 of the Algorithm Competition.  A maximum of 500 competitors will advance.  Members will be rated at the conclusion of the Qualification Round based on their performance against others with the same problem set.  All qualifiers will be assigned tournament seeds based on their Algorithm rating following the Qualification Round.
			<br/><br/>

            </a>Online Elimination Rounds</h3>
			Everyone who competes in an online round must login to the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than ten (10) minutes prior to the start of the online round. (See the schedule for competition dates and times.) TopCoder members from around the world may be participating in the online rounds, but all start times will be communicated as Eastern Time, so contestants in different time zones must adjust accordingly. If a coder does not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition.
			<br/><br/>
			All competitors who have qualified for an online round will be assigned to a specific room. <b>TopCoder will determine all room assignments prior to the start of each online round in the TopCoder Iron Man format, which assigns members to rooms according to tournament seed such that the higher seeded members are assigned to the lower numbered rooms</b>.  The dates and times of the online rounds of competition are as follows:

            <span class="bodySubtitle">Scoring and Advancing during Online Rounds</span><br/>
			After each round of competition, the winners from each of the assigned rooms will be identified and will advance to the next online round. Room winners are defined as the top scorer from each room. To be considered a room winner, a participant must have positive (i.e., greater than zero) points. Coder advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round (see Competition Round Structure) for each coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater-than-zero) point total. The structure of the online rounds is as follows:

			<ul><li><b>Online Round #1</b><br/>Up to 500 coders will compete in Round #1 and up to 200 will advance. The room winners in each of up to 50 rooms will automatically advance to Online Round #2. The remaining 150 spots will be "wildcards", and will be awarded based on total points across all rooms. (In the event there are less than 50 room winners in Round #1, the total number of wildcard spots will be equal to 200 minus the actual number of room winners.)</li></ul>

			<ul><li><b>Online Round #2</b><br/>Up to 200 coders will compete and up to 100 will advance. The room winners in each of up to 20 rooms will automatically advance to Online Round #3. The remaining 80 spots will be wildcards and will be awarded based on total points across all rooms. (In the event there are less than 20 room winners in Round #2, the total number of wildcard spots will be equal to 100 minus the actual number of room winners.)</li></ul>

			<ul><li><b>Online Round #3</b><br/>Up to 100 coders will compete and up to 50 will advance. The room winners in each of up to 10 rooms will automatically advance to Online Round #4. The remaining 40 spots will be wildcards and will be awarded based on total points across all rooms. (In the event there are less than 10 room winners in Round #3, the total number of wildcard spots will be equal to 50 minus the actual number of room winners.)</li></ul>

			<ul><li><b>Online Round #4</b><br/>Up to 50 coders will compete and up to 24 will advance. The room winners in each of up to 5 rooms will automatically advance to the field of Semifinalists. The remaining 19 spots will be wildcards and will be awarded based on total points across all rooms. (In the event there are less than 5 room winners in Round #4, the total number of wildcard spots will be equal to 24 minus the actual number of room winners.)</li></ul>

			NOTE:  In the event of a tie for any advancing position (i.e., room winner or wildcard spot), the tie will be resolved in the following manner:

			<ul>
			<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during the rounds of the tournament in which all of the tied participants were presented with the same set of problems (excluding the Qualification Round).</li>
			<li>If a tie still remains, then by rating (higher is better) following the Qualification Round.</li>
			<li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round.</li>.
			</ul>

            <span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Round Structure</span><br/>
			With the exception of the Qualification Round, each online and onsite round of competition consists of three phases: the Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. (Note: The format of these competition rounds is similar to the format of the Single Round Matches.  The rules in place for the Single Round Matches as of January 11, 2005 will also apply to the online and onsite rounds of the TCCC.)

			<ul>
			<li><b>The Coding Phase</b> is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened until the time it was submitted.  During the online rounds, the Coding Phase will last 75 minutes.  During the onsite rounds, the Coding Phase will last 85 minutes.
			<li><b>The Challenge Phase</b> is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.  During the online rounds, the Challenge Phase will last 15 minutes.  During the onsite round, the Challenge Phase will last 10 minutes.
			<li><b>The System Testing Phase</b> is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.
			</ul>

            <span class="bodySubtitle">Onsite Semifinal and Championship Rounds</span><br/>
			The twenty-four (24) advancers from Online Round #4 will travel to the Santa Clara Marriott on Tuesday, March 8th or Wednesday, March 9th to compete in the Semifinal round of the tournament being held on Thursday, March 10.  All contestants must arrive at the Santa Clara Marriott no later than 4:00 PM PST on Wednesday, March 9th.  All contestants must confirm their attendance at the onsite rounds no later than 5:00 PM EST on Friday, February 18, 2005.  If a contestant is unable to attend the onsite rounds, he/she will forfeit his/her eligibility to receive any prizes awarded to onsite finalists, and his/her spot in the tournament will be given to the next highest overall scorer from Online Round #4.
			<br/><br/>
			TopCoder will provide travel arrangements for each competitor, up to a cost of $1,000 per person.  (That is, if a contestant's airfare is greater than $1,000, the contestant will be responsible for the difference between the cost of the airfare and $1,000.)  TopCoder will also provide ground transportation to and from the airport, as well as hotel accommodations and certain meals for each contestant.  All other expenses are the responsibility of the contestant.  TopCoder will not provide travel or lodging accommodations for competitor guests at the 2005 TCCC.
			<br/><br/>
			TopCoder will determine the room assignments for the Semifinal rooms prior to the start of each Semifinal round, in a manner such that the average competitor rating (following the Qualification Round) for each room will be similar.  The dates and times of the onsite Semifinal and Championship rounds are as follows:

			</table>
			<br/><br/>

			The Semifinal Round will consist of three (3) rooms of eight (8) coders each. The winner in each room will advance to the Championship Round.  The 2nd and 3rd place finishers in each round will participate in one (1) Wildcard Round.  The winner of the Wildcard Round will also advance to the Championship Round.
			<br/><br/>
			The Championship Round will be a single round of four (4) coders. First, second, third and fourth place in the Championship round are determined by comparing the total points of each coder, with the highest point value placing first. The winner of the Championship Round will be the coder with the highest point total for the round. In the event of a tie in the Semifinal and/or Championship rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order):

			<ul>
			<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during Online Rounds #1, #2, #3 and #4 of the 2005 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge</li>
			<li>If a tie still remains, then by rating (higher is better) following the Qualification Round.</li>
			<li>If a tie still remains in the Semifinal or Wildcard round, then all tied coders will advance to the Championship Round</li>
			<li>If a tie still remains in the Championship round, then the prize money will be distributed equally amongst the tied coders</li>
			</ul>
