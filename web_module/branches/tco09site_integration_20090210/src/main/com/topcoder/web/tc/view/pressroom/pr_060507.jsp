<p><strong>Glastonbury, Conn., &amp; Dulles, Va., June 7, 2007 &#151;</strong>TopCoder&#174;, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, skills assessment and competitive software development, and AOL, a global Web services company, today announced that the 2007 TopCoder&#174; Open (TCO07) will be webcast live at the AOL&#174; Developer site (<a target="_blank" href="<tc-webtag:linkTracking link='http://dev.aol.com' refer='pr_060507' />">http://dev.aol.com</a>) on Friday, June 29. Coverage of the TCO07 finals from the Mirage Resort in Las Vegas begins at 21:00 GMT.</p>

<p>The 2007 TopCoder Open, sponsored by AOL, will be presented live on the Internet, bringing the excitement and drama of competitive coding at the highest level as some of the brightest programmers and designers in the world work against the clock and each other for a share of $260,000 in prizes. Algorithm, component design and development, Studio graphic design and Marathon Match championships will all be at stake during the ultimate test of computing prowess, speed and accuracy.</p>

<p>"It is our goal with this webcast to bring the same level of excitement and production value to the sport of programming that viewers experience with any number of major league competitions," said Rob Hughes, President and COO of TopCoder, Inc. "These competitors are the very best in mathematics, problem solving and software development."</p>

<p>More than 4,600 talented computer programmers from around the world began competing in qualifying rounds of the TCO earlier this year. Through a series of online rounds, this field has been narrowed down to 77 final competitors comprised of 48 Algorithm, 14 Component, 7 Studio, and 8 Marathon Match competitors.</p>

<p>On Friday, June 29, viewers will be able to visit the AOL Developer site at <a target="_blank" href="<tc-webtag:linkTracking link='http://dev.aol.com' refer='pr_060507' />">http://dev.aol.com</a> to watch the competition unfold live starting at 21:00 GMT / 5:00pm EDT / 2:00pm PDT. Over the course of the three hour webcast, viewers will be able to watch the high stakes software competition through live views of the arena, entertaining profiles and interviews with contestants - and in-depth coverage of the final results - in real time.</p>
