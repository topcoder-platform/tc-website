<span class="bigTitle">Why do YOU deserve a trip to the finals in Las Vegas?</span>
<br><br>
Did you miss out on making it as a TCO finalist?  Still want to see the finals in Las Vegas anyway?  Here's your chance!
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">The contest:</span><br/>
Write to us and tell us why you'd be a good candidate to come to Las Vegas and blog about the 2006 TopCoder&reg; Open, Sponsored by AMD.  We want someone to join us at the finals and give a member's perspective on the competition, the atmosphere, and the city.  You'll win a trip to Las Vegas, as well as have your blog posted on the TCO website for everyone to read.  
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Who can compete:</span><br/>
In order to be eligible, you must be a registered TopCoder member who is 18 years of age or older as of May 1, 2006. All eligible members may submit an entry, regardless of their current standing in the TCO, but only the entries of those members who are not TCO finalists or Review Board members will be considered. That is, contestants cannot be both a TCO finalist or Review Board member AND the winner of this contest.
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">How it will work:</span><br/>
Email your story to TopCoder at <a href="mailto: pickme@topcoder.com">pickme@topcoder.com</a>. TopCoder staff will read through the submissions and choose the member they think is most deserving of the trip.  The winning submission will be featured in the TCO06 program and on the TopCoder website.  
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">What you get:</span><br/>
The member with the winning submission wins an expenses-paid trip to Las Vegas, including airfare, hotel and certain meals paid for by TopCoder.  But you don't get this all for free!  We'll want you to write about your experience as the competitions take place so we can update your blog throughout the finals.  
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Important dates:</span><br/>
Submit your story now! The deadline for submission is March 31, 2006, at 5:00PM EST.  Submissions received after that time will not be considered.  The lucky winner will be announced on the website and via email on April 17, 2006.  
<br><br>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Rules:</span><br/>
Each eligible member may make only one submission of 500 words or less.  Submissions over 500 words will not be taken into consideration.  Submissions must be in English and be a .doc, .pdf or .txt file.
<br><br>
The winner must be able to travel to Las Vegas, NV, USA from May 2 - May 6, 2006. If the selected winner does not provide TopCoder with evidence of possessing the necessary documents and/or visas to travel to the U.S. as of April 17, 2006, TopCoder will select another winner.
