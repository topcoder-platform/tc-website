  						<p class="regmiddle"><strong>Overview</strong><br/>
  						The 2004 JavaOne<sup>SM</sup> Coding Challenge will take place entirely at the JavaOne<sup>SM</sup>
  						Conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, CA from June 28th through June 30th.  Prizes will be awarded throughout
  						the Challenge, with the winner of each daily competition receiving a "grand" prize.</p>

  						<p class="regmiddle">All expenses to attend the JavaOne Conference, including the conference registration fee, and the
  						JavaOne Coding Challenge are the responsibility of the individual.</p>

  						<p class="regmiddle"><strong>Eligibility</strong><br/>
						Each contestant must have purchased one of the following attendee passes to the JavaOne Conference in order to
						participate in the JavaOne Coding Challenge:</p>

						<blockquote><ul class="regmiddle">
						<li>Conference Plus Pass</li>
						<li>Conference Pass</li></ul></blockquote>

  						<p class="regmiddle">To register for the JavaOne Conference, visit
  						<a href="http://javaone.medialiveinternational.com/sf2004/registration.html" target="_blank">http://javaone.medialiveinternational.com/sf2004/registration.html</a></p>

						<p class="regmiddle">The JavaOne Coding Challenge is open to citizens and lawful permanent residents of the United States*,
						and to all non-immigrants currently in the United States* with a valid Visa, who are at least 18 years of age.</p>

						<p class="regmiddle"><font size="1">*Including the U.S. territories of Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands</font></p>

						<p class="regmiddle">Employees and former employees of TopCoder, Inc., Sun Microsystems, Inc., JavaOne Conference
						sponsors and exhibitors, and those involved in the production (including prize suppliers), implementation and
						distribution of this tournament and their advertising or promotion agencies, parent companies, service providers,
						agents, officers, subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other persons or entities directly associated with the

						are ineligible to enter the tournament.</p>

						<p class="regmiddle"><strong>Registration</strong><br/>
                        Registration for the JavaOne Coding Challenge will occur onsite at JavaOne.  To register for the competition, individuals will be required to provide their first name, last name, email address, and cell phone number (in case we need to notify you of your advancement to the final round).  Registrants will also create a unique username ("handle") and password to log in to the Competition Arena.  All participants will be identified solely by their handle in the Competition Arena, however the full name and handle of each competitor may be published on TopCoder's and/or Sun's website, announcing the results of the competition.</p>

                        <p class="regmiddle">All information provided during registration will be the property of Sun Microsystems, Inc.</p>

						<p class="regmiddle"><strong>Competitions</strong><br/>
						The JavaOne Coding Challenge provides a hands-on experience for conference attendees to apply what they learn during
						the conference tracks.  Following each day's technical presentations, attendees can proceed to the TopCoder arena
						where attendees will attempt to solve various problems in the "Competition Arena."  At the conclusion of each day's
						Qualifying Round, a 4-person competition will be held.  The four individuals who achieved the highest two scores for
						their respective problem during the Qualification Round will be invited to compete in the afternoon's competition.
						The schedule of competitions is as follows:</p>

            <p class="regmiddle"><strong>Competition Structure</strong><br/>
            Java will be the only allowable programming language in the competition.  Each competition will have 3 phases -
            the Coding Phase, the Challenge Phase and the System Testing Phase.  The following describes the different phases
            of competition: </p>

            <blockquote><ul class="regmiddle">
            <li><strong>The Coding Phase</strong> is a timed event where all contestants are presented with either one of two possible
            questions or the same questions, depending on the round.  If an individual is presented with more than one (1) question
            during a round of competition, the questions will have varying levels of complexity and, accordingly, varying levels of
            point earnings potential. Multiple problems may be worked on in any order, and at the same time.  A solution to a problem
            may be submitted multiple times, however a point penalty of 10% of the maximum value of the problem will be assessed for
            each submission.  Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are
            calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened to the time it was submitted, regardless
            of the time it took to submit any previous solutions to that problem, if any.  (NOTE:  Each participant will be presented
            with one (1) of two questions in the Qualification Round.  Two (2) questions will be presented to each participant during
            each competition.)</li>

            <li><strong>The Challenge Phase</strong> is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality
            of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the
            defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 50 points as a
            penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.  (NOTE:  There is no Challenge Phase during the
            Qualification Round.)</li>

            <li><strong>The System Testing Phase</strong> is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged.
            If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were
            originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code
            submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered
            flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful
            challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</li>
            </ul></blockquote>

            <p class="regmiddle"><strong>About the Prizes</strong><br/>
			Prizes will be awarded to each person who participates in the Qualification Rounds.  The winner of each day's competition will be
			awarded a 'grand' prize.  The prizes are as follows:</p>
