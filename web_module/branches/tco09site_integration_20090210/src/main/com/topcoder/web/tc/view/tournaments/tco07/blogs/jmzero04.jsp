                        <br>
                        <p>On Wednesday night TopCoder treated us to a dinner and show at the "<a href="http://www.excalibur.com/entertainment/tournament_of_kings.aspx" target="_blank">Tournament of Kings</a>." Jousting, fireworks, and hand-to-hand combat to the death proved to be welcome relaxation after the stress of TopCoder competition.  At the event, the TopCoder section was assigned to cheer for Spain, though I think some of the competitors sympathies may have drifted more towards cheering for the Russian champion.  I particularly noticed <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11829284" context="algorithm"/> seemed a bit unwilling to cheer on our fated-to-lose-anyway Spaniard.</p>

                        <div align=center><img alt="Tournament Scores" src="/i/tournament/tco07/blogs/jmzero04tournament.png"></div><br />
                        
                        <p>I'm sorry I was unable to get an actual photo of the event, but they said there was no picture-taking allowed and I didn't want an argument with the gigantic man standing in front of us in tight black pants.  Not only did he clearly have the strength to crush a contraband camera with his eyebrows, but he had the breeze-tossed blond hair and permanent "blue steel" expression of a man who'd done battle with many a romance-novel villain.  No, I'm sorry but my camera was staying well out of sight.</p> 
                        
                        <p>But while I can't show it to you, the show was great.  I was particularly impressed by the "human tower" acrobatic work; I have no idea how one man can be strong enough to support the weight of 8 others and still be agile enough to do a difficult tumbling run (on a dirt surface, no less). I also appreciated the effort that must go into presenting live jousting.  Real unpredictable animals, splintering lances, and a live audience must make for a nerve-wracking performance.</p>
                        
                        <p>Back to the competition front, below are the marathon standings just before the end of competition:</p>
                        
                        <div align=center><img alt="Marathon Scores" src="/i/tournament/tco07/blogs/jmzero04marathon.jpg"></div><br />
                        
                        <p>Here <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10600282" context="marathon"/> is enjoying a slight lead - but the nature of marathon scoring is such that his victory is far from certain.  In some past matches, preliminary and final scoring have shown only a fleeting resemblance - so  for the other competitors there's still plenty of room to hope.  Leaving the competition area, early favorite <tc-webtag:handle coderId="21932422" context="marathon"/> commented that this "just wasn't [his] problem - maybe in a week, but not in 8 hours".  All of the competitors I caught up with noted the difficulty of the problem and the challenges of addressing it in such a short timespan (short for a marathon problem at least).  Regardless of the eventual winner, my impression was that the first marathon competition was a smashing success, and I think this impression was shared by the many spectators who watched or who tried their hand at piloting a ship themselves.</p>
