<DIV CLASS="statTextBig">Conditions of Participation</DIV>
By participating in the tournament, you agree to be bound by these rules and to all decisions of TopCoder, which are final, binding and conclusive in all matters.<BR/><BR/>
Contestants must not cheat.  All ideas for any code and/or challenge submitted must be the contestant's alone.<BR/><BR/>
Winners in each round of competition will be those competitors who win the most points in their respective rooms.  All decisions relating to the viability of submissions, the 
ranking of submissions and all other matters pertaining to the tournament shall be within the sole discretion of TopCoder or its designee and shall be final and binding in all 
respects.<BR/><BR/>
Prizewinners will be notified via e-mail and the U.S. Postal Service within 10 days of the completion of the online Regional Final Round that they have won a prize. They will also 
be forwarded an Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release to be completed and returned to TopCoder prior to advancing to the onsite Semifinal and Championship 
rounds. Prizes will be presented within 60 days of making an eligibility determination.  Unclaimed or undeliverable prizes will not be awarded.<BR/><BR/>
As a condition of participation in the tournament, ALL information provided by you in your TopCoder member profile must be comprehensive, accurate and up-to-date.  
TopCoder may require you to complete an additional registration form to register for the tournament.  In order to be eligible to participate in the tournament, you must 
have completed any and all registration forms required by TopCoder.<BR/><BR/>
As a condition of winning and redeeming a prize, winners will be required to return within 10 days of receipt a completed (i) Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity 
Release, and (ii) IRS Form W-9 or W-8BEN, as appropriate.  In completing the Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release, a winner (i) confirms his/her eligibility, 
(ii) represents and warrants that he/she has not cheated; that the idea for the code and/or challenge submitted is his/hers alone, (iii) verifies the accuracy of the 
demographic information submitted, (iv) authorizes TopCoder to publicize the tournament's results, (v) agrees to sign any applicable forms required by tax authorities, (vi) 
licenses to TopCoder rights to all information submitted during the tournament (including rights to source code and other executables), and (vii) releases TopCoder from 
liability arising out of any prize won.  The Form W-9 or W-8BEN is required by the IRS for tax reporting purposes.  If prize notification is returned as undeliverable, or the winner 
fails to return the Affidavit, or the W-9 or W-8BEN, as specified, the winner will be disqualified and the prize money won by the disqualified winner will be forfeited.  Providing 
false information in the registration process or in the required forms described in this paragraph will disqualify a winner.<BR/><BR/>
By participating in a tournament and redeeming a prize, a winner releases and agrees to hold harmless TopCoder, its affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotion agencies, 
sponsors (including Sun Microsystems, Inc.), and prize suppliers, and all of their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents, from and against any and all liability for any loss, property 
damage or damage to person, including without limitation, death and injury, due in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, from or arising out of participation in this tournament, 
or participation in any tournament-related activity, or the receipt, use or misuse of a prize. TopCoder specifically disclaims all liability associated with, and makes no warranties 
with regard to, any prize given.<BR/><BR/>
In addition, all prizewinners agree to cooperate with TopCoder's publicity efforts, without further compensation. This includes the agreement to use their name, address (city 
and state) and likeness for publicity purposes, where legal, for this or similar future tournaments, and to use the statements made by, or attributed to, the winners relating to 
TopCoder and any and all rights to said use, without further compensation.<BR/><BR/>
TopCoder reserves the right, in it's sole discretion, to revoke any and all privileges associated with competing in this tournament, and to take any other action it deems 
appropriate, for no reason or any reason whatsoever, including if TopCoder suspects competitors of cheating, tampering with the entry process, the operation of the Web 
site, or the tournament process, or otherwise being in violation of the rules. TopCoder reserves the right to cancel, terminate or modify the tournament if it is not capable of 
completion as planned for any reason, including infection by computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention or technical failures of any sort.<BR/><BR/>
 <B>Other</B><BR/>
The tournament is void in whole or in part where prohibited by law.<BR/><BR/>
