            <h2>2005 TCCC Spectator Showdown<br/>
            Official Rules and Regulations</h2>

            <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Overview</span><br/>
            The 2005 TCCC Spectator Showdown will take place entirely at the TopCoder Collegiate Challenge at the Santa Clara Marriott in Santa Clara,
            CA on Thursday, March 10 and Friday, March 11, 2005. Two (2) grand prizes will be awarded at the end of each day’s competition to the highest scorer on
            each of the two (2) problems presented.</span>

			<p>All expenses to attend the TopCoder Collegiate Challenge are the responsibility of the individual.</p>

			<p><span class="bodySubtitle">Eligibility</span><br/>
			The TCCC Spectator Showdown is open to all registered TopCoder members who are at least 18 years of age.
			Individuals may register as a TopCoder member at the TopCoder Collegiate Challenge.</p>

			<p>Employees of TopCoder, Inc., and members of the immediate families and/or persons living in the same household as
			such persons, are ineligible to enter the tournament.  Finalists in the Algorithm and Component Competitions of the
			TopCoder Collegiate Challenge are also ineligible to enter the tournament.</p>

         <p>The winner of Thursday’s competition may not compete in Friday’s competition.</p>
			
         <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Structure</span><br/>
			The allowable programming languages in the competition will be Java, C++, C# and VB.NET.  Each competition will have 2
			phases - the Coding Phase and the System Testing Phase.  The following describes the different phases of competition:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>The Coding Phase</strong> is a timed event where all contestants are presented with a set of two questions.  A solution to each problem may be submitted only one time.
				Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any
				solution that successfully compiles and are calculated based on the total time elapsed from the time the problem
				was opened to the time it was submitted, regardless of the time it took to submit any previous solutions to
				that problem, if any.</li>

				<li><strong>The System Testing Phase</strong> is applied to all submitted. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed,
				the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission.
				The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If
				the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The
				same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>During the competition, the Coding Phase will last 30 minutes for each participant. The System Testing Phase begins
			immediately upon submission of a solution.</p>

			<p><span class="bodySubtitle">About the Prizes</span><br/>
			Prizes will be awarded to the first 100 people who participate in the competition. The highest scorer in each of the
