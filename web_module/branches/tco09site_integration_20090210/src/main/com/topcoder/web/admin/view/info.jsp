                                        This means that there is a difference between the ResultSetContainer object that the cache has
                                        and the ResultSetContainer object that the application server has.  The solution is the match them
                                        up by updating the classes in the cache's classpath and restarting it.
                                    </p>

                                            It's likely that you just did a move to the application server and therefore
                                            that code is the latest.  You should just move up the classes.jar and shared.jar from that
                                            build to the cache server.  In that case, use the instructions for the link above

                                            Now you need to insert records into the image table for each of new member photos.
                                            There is no sequence for this, so you have to create the id's by hand.  Use the following
                                            query to figure out what id to start with.
                                            <p class="input">
                                                select max(image_id)+1<br />
                                                  from image<br />
                                                 where image_id &lt; 10000;
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            This query will generate the insert statements for the image table.  You'll just have
                                            to replace the xxx's with the id's you are manually coming up with.
                                            <p class="input">
                                                select 'insert into image (image_id, file_name, image_type_id, path_id) ' ||<br />

                                            If the graphic designer had to change any of the file names, that should have been
                                            communicated to you.  At this point, you'll want to adjust each of the insert statements
                                            that you just generated to have to correct file name.  Likely it's just what was
                                            generated with a 2 appended before the extension.

                                            are in the same order as the ones you generated for image's, so you can just work

                                    <p>
                                        Generally "the cache" refers to the distributed cache that runs on 192.168.12.61.
                                        There are a number of different parts of our system that depend on it.
                                        www.topcoder.com uses it to cache statistics, user information that would usually
                                        be looked up by the security tool, round table users (until we replace them with jive 4.x),
                                        graph images and more.  software.topcoder.com uses the cache for it's homepage list
                                        of top downloads.
                                    </p>

                                        We also have a distributed cache instance running for the technical assessment tool.
                                        This is used by both the candidate interface code and the server side processor.
                                        It can be bounced similarly to "the cache" as indicated <a href="#cache2">href</a>

                                            where &lt;key&gt; is some part of the key used to store an object in the cache.
                                            <p>
                                                For example, if you wanted to refresh the site so that the system would go
                                                to the database the next time a user loaded any coder's member profile you would
                                                execute <span class="input">java com.topcoder.shared.distCache.SimpleClient removelike member_profile</span>
                                                because the data for the member profile page is stored with a key that contains
                                                the string "member_profile".  You could remove nearly all the data about a particular
                                                coder by executing <span class="input">java com.topcoder.shared.distCache.SimpleClient removelike &lt;user_id&gt;</span>
                                                because data that is stored on a per-user basis is likely to have their user_id
                                                as part of the key in the cache.

                                        This is currently highly unlikely as there is currently a cache running on the same box as the
                                        new software site.  Once we get the TopCoder site updated to jboss, we'll likely start using the

                                The Technical Assessment System is composed of a number of pieces.  The application server
                                contains the EJB's that are called by the processor(s).  It also takes care of the front
                                end jsp/servlet layer.  The processor layer takes care of all the business logic.  It puts
                                items on testing/compiler queues, makes EJB calls to persist data to the database etc.
                                There are of course, testers and compilers.  Finally, there is a distributed cache that is
                                used by both the processor layer and the servlet layer.

                                                    Enter your template text.  The email content should have been provided
                                                    to you using one of the templates available on the corporate drive.
                                                    Those templates include the necessary xsl code to make everything work.
                                                    Often times, m$ will add extra bad characters to the content, to solve
                                                    this, I recommend you paste the template to a basic non-microsoft editor
                                                    (like gvim) and this will either fix the characters that are bad, or
                                                    allow you to see which need fixing.  You can then copy from this editor
                                                    to the text area.  Some of the characters to watch for are ' " and -
                                                    m$ converts them to something odd.

                                            need to create it.  You do this by either <a href="#misc12">creating a command</a>
                                            in the query tool or setting up a static address list.
                                            There are a few things that are extremely important when writing a query.
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Your command must be created in the Transactional database</li>
                                                <li>Your command must belong to the command group "Email"</li>
                                                <li>You should use the "email_user" view, not the user table</li>
                                                <li>
                                                    You must constrain on status='A' in your query.  People that are
                                                    not active must not get email
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    In all likelihood, you need to constrain on coder_notify.  Only those
                                                    that have signed up for your email should get it.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    You have to alias the email address to "email_address" in order for
                                                    it to work, see below for an example.
                                                </li>
                                            </ol>
                                            Here's an example query:

                                                SELECT u.email AS email_address<br />

                                                    generally address the recipient by handle, so you may need to add
                                                    a handle field
                                                </li>

                                                    mode or bulk entry.  It's pretty straight forward.  You just need

                                            Example: competitions@topcoder.com
                                            competition@topcoder.com is a good address to use because bounce backs
                                            will get reported and will will disable those accounts which helps us
                                            avoid getting put into spam lists etc.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Enter the subject of your email</li>
                                        <li>
                                            Choose a start time, this is when the email will go out.  Give yourself some
                                            time to receive the test email and check it over to be sure everything is perfect.
                                            I would recommend giving yourself more than an hour.

                                        <li>
                                            Choose an end time.  This is when the system will stop trying to send your
                                            email.  Make this a day after your start time.  That will be plenty.

                                            you can create your own by creating a static address list in the "test" group.
                                            This list should include all the people that need to proof read your email.

                                            You're done.  Wait for you test email and check it over.  If there is a problem
                                            cancel the job, and you can start the process again.

                                    <p>
                                        If you've scheduled an email and it attempted to go out, but there were errors
                                        the most likely cause is having bad characters in your template.  If there are any
                                        &amp; characters in the template, you need to "escape" them.  You should also be
                                        sure you don't have any characters that aren't part of basic ascii.  To escape a
                                        chunk of text put it within the following &lt;![CDATA[&lt;your text here&gt;]]&gt;.
                                        Likely culsprits are urls.

                                        If that's not the problem, then perhaps the email scheduler has crapped out.
                                        In this case, you'll want to restart it.

                                                    Your insert statements will look like the following:
                                                    <p class="input">
                                                        insert into image (image_id, file_name, image_type_id, path_id) values (xxx, 'companyname_CodingFrame.gif', 4, 4);<br />
                                                        insert into image (image_id, file_name, image_type_id, path_id) values (xxx, 'companyname_WatchRoom.gif', 5, 4);<br />
                                                        insert into image (image_id, file_name, image_type_id, path_id) values (xxx, 'companyname_Lobby.gif', 2, 4);<br />
                                                        insert into image (image_id, file_name, image_type_id, path_id) values (xxx, 'companyname_Login.gif', 7, 4);<br />
                                                        insert into image (image_id, file_name, image_type_id, path_id) values (xxx, 'companyname_ScoreBoard.gif', 3, 4);
                                                    </p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    You'll need to replace the "xxx" in the insert statements with actual
                                                    image_id values.  You can figure out the next image id to use by executing
                                                    the following in the informixoltp datbase <span class="input">
                                                    select max(image_id)+1 from image where image_id &lt; 10000</span>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>execute those insert statements</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Next, you need to associate the images with the TopCoder company record.  You do
                                            this by executing the following in the informixoltp database:
                                            <p class="input">
                                                delete from company_image_xref where company_id = 1;<br />
                                                insert into company_image_xref values (1, xxx, 1);<br />
                                                insert into company_image_xref values (1, xxx, 1);<br />
                                                insert into company_image_xref values (1, xxx, 1);<br />
                                                insert into company_image_xref values (1, xxx, 1);<br />
                                                insert into company_image_xref values (1, xxx, 1);
                                            </p>
                                            Where "xxx" is the image_id's you used for the insert statements.
                                        </li>

                                    <p>
                                        Most likely, this means that the school in question needs to be normalized.  During
                                        registration, if the user doesn't enter the exactly correct school name, then
                                        a new school record gets created for them.  Occasionally, we need to go through
                                        and make all the people who are associated with a school record that is not *the*
                                        record for the school join the crowd.
                                    </p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            You can root out all the school records that are extra by executing a query like
                                            <span class="input">select * from school where lower(name) like '%xxx%'</span>
                                            in the informixoltp database where 'xxx' is a substring of the correct school name.
                                            You can proceeed like that to figure out all the school
                                            records that should be normalized.  The correct school will be the one with the lowest
                                            school_id, it will also have a user_id=0 if we've ever normalized for this school
                                            before.  user_id=0 basically means that the school is system generated or approved

                                        <li>
                                            Once you know *the* school, and have your list of school_id's
                                            you can run the following <span class="input">update current_school set school_id = &lt;school_id&gt;
                                            where school_id in (&lt;school_id_list&gt;);</span>

                                        <li>
                                            School information is also stored in the demographic_response tables.  You can
                                            also normalize this data.  You can figure out which coder's should be normalized
                                            by running <span class="input">select * from demographic_response where demographic_question_id = 20
                                            and demographic_response like '%xxx%''</span> where 'xxx' is a substring of the correct
                                            school name.  This will give you a list of users that can be updated with <span class="input">
                                            update current_school set school_id = &lt;school_id&gt; and coder_id in (&lt;user_id_list&gt;);</span>
                                            school_id is *the* school.

                                        The query tool contains queries which one can execute programatically and fetch
                                        the results.  One can associate a number of queries with a single command.
                                        In this way, if you have a single page that needs a number of different datasets
                                        you can associate all the relevant queries with a single command.  When the command
                                        is executed, you will get the results from each of your queries in seperate
                                        ResultSetContainer objects.  See the codebase for examples, this is used
                                        throughout the web site middle tier code.

                                            the results of this query.

                                            you would like to rank.  For example if you would like to rank coders by
                                            rating, you would enter the index of the rating column.  This is a 1-based

                                            For example, lets say you have a number of links to www.topcoder.com, using the id
                                            you can identify which links where actually clicked.  Keep in mind that the system does
                                            not track clicks by people in the topcoder office network, so if you're looking for
