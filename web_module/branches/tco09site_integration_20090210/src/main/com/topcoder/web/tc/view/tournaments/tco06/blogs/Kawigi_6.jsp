<br>
Time for the "Who looks the most/least like their member photo" contest!  I'm just taking a sampling of people I've met here and a chance to meet. <br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="272072" darkBG="true" /> is recognizable from his member photo, although contrary to popular belief, he is not green.  He actually isn't nearly as pale as he looks in his profile.  Also, he doesn't normally look so annoyed.  I think there was an earlier period in TopCoder history where members tried to look intimidating in their photos (why?), and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="272072" darkBG="true" /> is a fine manifestation of this.
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-01.jpg"><br>
<em><tc-webtag:handle coderId="272072" darkBG="true" /> - he's not actually mean or green.</em></div> 
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="10574855" darkBG="true" /> was thinner than I thought he would be, and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11829284" darkBG="true" /> was less thin than I thought he would be.  I think it made a bigger difference with <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10574855" darkBG="true" />, I suspect I wouldn't have recognized him on the street. <br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="311170" darkBG="true" /> was easy to recognize, mainly because he's the only person with the hairdo from his profile picture.  Everyone will be glad to know that he isn't always making that face, though.  It goes back to that intimidation era.  <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8357090" darkBG="true" /> on the other hand, has somewhat wilder hair than I imagined, probably partly because it's hard to tell one way or the other in his photo.  Part of that might be from the background TopCoder puts on all the pictures, I think maybe some of his stray hair got cut off. <br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="15664457" darkBG="true" /> looks exactly like his member photo, or close enough that I had no doubt at all who he is.  It helps that he has about that much smile most of the time, and unlike other long-haired competitors (who pretty much all wear their hair back), he took his picture with his hair back, the way he normally wears it. \
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-02.jpg"><br>
<em>If you're going to wear your hair back, you might as well take your picture that way.</em>
</div>
<br /><br />
Conversely, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8355516" darkBG="true" /> took me a minute to recognize (it wasn't THAT hard, though).  The fact that he keeps his hair in a ponytail was part of it, but it's also that he's usually got this grin on his face that you don't see on his profile photo. <br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" darkBG="true" /> can often be found in the same place as <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8355516" darkBG="true" />, the difference is that while <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8355516" darkBG="true" /> stays quiet and hunched over a little, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" darkBG="true" /> stands tall and is quite talkative.  As far as matching <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" darkBG="true" /> to his picture, it's clear he's the same guy in the picture, but he could use an update.  <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" darkBG="true" /> has matured and filled out a little since he started TopCoder.  Are you listening, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" darkBG="true" />? 
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-03.jpg"><br>
<em><tc-webtag:handle coderId="144400" darkBG="true" /> with his confident "Blue Steel" look.</em></div>
<br /><br />
Neither <tc-webtag:handle coderId="14970299" darkBG="true" /> nor <tc-webtag:handle coderId="269554" darkBG="true" />'s profile pictures do them justice at all.  I wouldn't have even recognized <tc-webtag:handle coderId="14970299" darkBG="true" /> without his name-badge thing; he doesn't look like he's falling asleep at the end of a bad hair day in real life.  As for <tc-webtag:handle coderId="269554" darkBG="true" />, who could probably just about be voted "most likely TopCoder to appear on the cover of Teen Beat", there's something about his member photo that just isn't right - it looks like he hasn't slept in about a day and a half, and he's looking down slightly, which makes the top part of his head look a bit too large (perhaps he desired that it look like his brain is trying to expand outside of his skull or something). 
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-04.jpg"><br>
<em>Could <tc-webtag:handle coderId="269554" darkBG="true" /> be the next super-genious supermodel?</em>
</div>
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="262056" darkBG="true" /> doesn't look unlike his member photo, but not particularly like it either.  I give him a 5 for matching. <br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="7338095" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="309982" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8365685" darkBG="true" /> are three people I would actually recognize on the street from their TopCoder photos, but that street would most likely be Las Vegas Boulevard or somewhere in Poland.
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-05.jpg"><br>
<em>Recognizable Poles.</em>
</div>
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-06.jpg"><br> 
<em>Semifinal 1 winner <tc-webtag:handle coderId="309982" darkBG="true" /> is also easy to pick out.</em>
</div>
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="15082287" darkBG="true" /> was also fairly recognizable, but I don't think the picture in his profile is much more than a couple months old.  <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10019533" darkBG="true" /> also has the advantage of a recent picture, and looks just as much like <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8357090" darkBG="true" /> as one would guess from looking at it.  <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7501828" darkBG="true" /> actually also has <tc-webtag:handle coderId="15082287" darkBG="true" /> 's hairdo now, rather than what's in his photo, and I didn't recognize him at first. <br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="7340263" darkBG="true" /> was also pretty recognizable. <br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="7442498" darkBG="true" /> gets about a 7 in my opinion, because while he does look like his picture, he definitely looked less like his picture than his picture did (I know, I'm a tough judge). <br /><br />
I had an easy time recognizing <tc-webtag:handle coderId="275071" darkBG="true" />, but not so much because of his TopCoder picture as from the picture at the bottom of <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/finals/WhatsNew.htm">this page</a>.  Unfortunately, his member photo suffers from the intimidation era as well.  Also, like I've said about others, he doesn't wear his hair down like in his member photo, and he also has longer hair than his member photo (despite what he says). <br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-07.jpg"><br>
<em> <tc-webtag:handle coderId="275071" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="15082287" darkBG="true" /> talking to their adoring fans in the arena.</em>
</div>
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="8527113" darkBG="true" /> was someone I didn't really recognize at all when I first met them, perhaps it's that he's a little less pale.  Perhaps he's also a bit taller than I imagined him.  Perhaps it's that intimidation era again.  Note to self: don't try to pronounce his handle. 
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-08.jpg"/><br>
<em>Something tells me the hair is more recent.</em>
</div>
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="270505" darkBG="true" /> is a good candidate for second most likely to be on the cover of Teen Beat, and just based on his build, he'd be one of my first picks for any contact sport.  It's not that he's big or built or anything, he just has a good, healthy, athletic sort of look.  His member photo isn't particularly flattering, but it's not bad either.  John - you should consider getting something less squinty and maybe with the rest of a smile. <br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-09.jpg"><br>
<em> <tc-webtag:handle coderId="270505" darkBG="true" /> when he's not squinting.</em> 
</div>
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="7446789" darkBG="true" /> had to introduce himself to me, but I should have guessed who he was.  The only people who might look remotely like him are <tc-webtag:handle coderId="275071" darkBG="true" /> <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10599449" darkBG="true" />, and he really doesn't look like either.  His hair is longer now, though, and he wears it in a ponytail. <br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="310333" darkBG="true" /> was someone I recognized immediately when I saw him.  He looks a little difference, but I think he actually has his facial expressions frozen like that.  His co-prefix <tc-webtag:handle coderId="346607" darkBG="true" />, however, was someone that took me a good while to recognize.  It seems like he recently updated his picture, but he's still in the "intimidation" phase.  Speaking of <tc-webtag:handle coderId="346607" darkBG="true" />, I like his new quote. <br /><br />
I'm not really sure how much <tc-webtag:handle coderId="261024" darkBG="true" /> looks like his picture, his picture has a bad glare, and I haven't seen him without sunglasses on here.  When he got called up for the Wildcard today, he made some sort of motion that I can only assume was some attempt at creating a "The Fonz"-like cool moment, but he started to lose his balance, which made it look more like an accidental dance. 
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-10.jpg"><br>
<em>Shiney <tc-webtag:handle coderId="261024" darkBG="true" /> or night club <tc-webtag:handle coderId="261024" darkBG="true" />?</em>
</div>
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="10270846" darkBG="true" />, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7546048" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8472826" darkBG="true" /> all definitely look like their member photos, but they don't have pictures that are particularly familiar to me.  *Nudge*  Take some time in the forums, guys! <tc-webtag:handle coderId="310430" darkBG="true" /> was also easy to pick out from his picture. 
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-11.jpg"><br>
<em> <tc-webtag:handle coderId="310430" darkBG="true" /> with a bit more sunshine in his smile.</em>
</div>
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="7462740" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="113178" darkBG="true" /> both look very much like their pictures.  <tc-webtag:handle coderId="260835" darkBG="true" /> was also easy to recognize, although maybe that's because I've met him before. 
<br /><br />
All 8 of the Design finalists look distinctly like their member photos, except for <tc-webtag:handle coderId="11797255" darkBG="true" />, whose photo doesn't really capture what he looks like at all, and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="252022" darkBG="true" />.  Actually, I think <tc-webtag:handle coderId="15891862" darkBG="true" /> almost looks more like <tc-webtag:handle coderId="252022" darkBG="true" /> 's picture than <tc-webtag:handle coderId="252022" darkBG="true" /> does. 
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-12.jpg"><br>
<em>Everyone's favorite designers.  Can you pick out the one who needs a new member photo?</em>
</div>
<br /><br />
As for the development finalists, I already mentioned <tc-webtag:handle coderId="15664457" darkBG="true" /> as someone who looked particularly like their picture.  <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7210680" darkBG="true" /> was another that was particularly easy to recognize, and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7548200" darkBG="true" /> is unmistakable.  The problem is that the rest of the development finalists all look like they're from China -- which is not a coincidence, sincethey actually are all from China.  Since I haven't talked to any of them that much, I'm probably not a good judge of whether they look like their pictures. 
<br /><br />
In the end, among competitors, I think the prize for "looks most like their member photo" goes to <tc-webtag:handle coderId="304031" darkBG="true" />.  If you looked at his picture and then walked around the room looking for him, you'd find him. <br /><br />
The prize for "looks least like their member photo" goes to <tc-webtag:handle coderId="10599449" darkBG="true" />.  His complexion is more brown than gray, and he definitely doesn't have "200 pixels or 3 inches wide" written across his face with a sans-serif font like in his profile.  Plus his hair is much longer.  I have no idea where that picture is from. 
<br /><br />
As for the admin side of things, I thought it was pretty easy to spot <tc-webtag:handle coderId="7267401" darkBG="true" />, and OlexiyO was just slightly harder to recognize (see his old competitive handle, <tc-webtag:handle coderId="303644" darkBG="true" /> for a picture). <br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-13.jpg"><br>
<em>OlexiyO does a promotional photo for Coca-Cola.</em>
</div>
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="14999860" darkBG="true" /> was one of the easiest people to identify, except that she was usually a blur, running between stuff that needed to happen.  The fact that I recognized mbnd96, though, is something I attribute to some kind of prophecy.  She has somewhat less hair and one less hat than in her member photo, and I think if I hadn't met her before at some point in time, I'd be wondering who she was for the whole event.  That would be a shame, too, because she won the <tc-webtag:handle coderId="8416646" darkBG="true" /> trivia challenge over the rest of the TopCoder team.
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-14.jpg"><br> 
<em>The women of TopCoder.</em> 
</div>
<br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="305384" darkBG="true" /> was another person who you knew when you saw him, and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="156859" darkBG="true" /> and <tc-webtag:handle coderId="160049" darkBG="true" /> weren't too hard to identify, either. <br /><br />
As for the extremes, the winner of the TC Admin "looks-the-most-like-their-photo" contest is definitely mike in my mind.  All considering, he made it too easy to recognize himself.  On the flip side, I have to give <tc-webtag:handle coderId="287131" darkBG="true" /> the award for "looks-nothing-like-his-photo."  Like OlexiyO, in order to get his member photo, you have to go use his old competition handle, which was <tc-webtag:handle coderId="159052" darkBG="true" />. 
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="/i/tournament/tco06/blogs/kawigi-06-15.jpg"><br>
<em>"Are these guys really the same person?" - <tc-webtag:handle coderId="251184" darkBG="true" /></em> 
</div>
<br /><br />
The final category to consider is spectators (and bloggers, of course, since we make up most 	of the spectators).  When I got in, it took me just a couple second to identify <tc-webtag:handle coderId="251184" darkBG="true" />, and when <tc-webtag:handle coderId="21518515" darkBG="true" /> came in, I also had an easy time recognizing her.  But then again, when there is such a limited group of females in the room, that becomes easier.  It also helps that she has an obsession with <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tournaments&d2=tco06&d3=blogs&d4=omgrace_6">taking pictures</a> <a target="_blank" href="/?t=sponsor&c=link&link=http://www.xanga.com/omgrace">of herself</a>.  Most of those pictures look more like her than her TopCoder picture. <br /><br />
<tc-webtag:handle coderId="282718" darkBG="true" />'s last picture update is a very good likeness as well, and it was nice having him as our spectator team. <br /><br />
For extremes, it looks like I have to tag myself with "looks-least-like-his-photo" - lots of people have said I don't really look like it.  I, of course, think I look just like me, but I am in severe need of a haircut, and I think that makes it harder to identify me with my clean-cut, clean-shaven profile picture.  On the other side is <tc-webtag:handle coderId="21471147" darkBG="true" />, who really looks just like that.  If we were doing sports, after picking <tc-webtag:handle coderId="270505" darkBG="true" /> to be on my team, I'd pick <tc-webtag:handle coderId="21471147" darkBG="true" />, because he's got a good blocker/center kind of build.
