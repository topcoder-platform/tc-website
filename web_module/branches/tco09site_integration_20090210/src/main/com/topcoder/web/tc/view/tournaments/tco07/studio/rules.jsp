<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    The 2007 TopCoder Open Studio Design Competition ("SDC") will take place between February 19, 2007 and June 29,
    2007. It will consist of eight (8) weeks of online competition and one (1) onsite final round, being the
    Championship round. The prize purse for this tournament is $30,000 in cash. The eight (8) competitors with the
    highest cumulative placement scores after the online rounds of competition will advance to the onsite Championship
    round, being held at The Mirage in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA on June 28, 2007.
</p>

<a name="eligibility"></a>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>
    TopCoder Studio members meeting the following eligibility criteria are eligible to compete in the SDC:
<ul>
    <li>Must be at least 18 years of age as of March 5, 2007; AND</li>
    <li>If not a US resident, must be living in, and participating from, your country of residence; AND</li>
    <li>Must currently be eligible for participation in TopCoder Studio projects (i.e. not suspended from TopCoder).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    TopCoder Studio members who are 18 years of age or older as of March 5, 2007 are eligible to win cash prizes, unless
    otherwise prohibited. The TopCoder Open is void in the Quebec province of Canada, and elsewhere where prohibited by
    applicable law. Cash prizes will not be paid to residents of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria.
</p>

<p>
    Employees of TopCoder, Inc. and of all official tournament sponsors, regardless of commitment date as sponsor,
    including any companies involved in the production (including prize suppliers), implementation and distribution of
    this tournament and their advertising or promotion agencies, parent companies, service providers, agents, officers,
    subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other persons or entities directly associated with the tournament and members of
    the immediate families and/or persons living in the same household as such persons, are ineligible to enter the
    tournament. If a competitor's employer signs up as an official sponsor of the tournament on or after February 19,
    2007, then that competitor will be disqualified from participating further in the tournament. TopCoder members who
    are performing internships for any official tournament sponsor between February 19 and June 29, 2007 are also
    ineligible to compete.
</p>

<p>
    Those members who are eligible to compete in any of the four tournament competitions will be permitted to
    participate in any/all of them online. However, in the event a member becomes a finalist in more than one
    competition and the onsite competition times overlap, the member must choose only one competition to participate in
    as a finalist by May 11, 2007.
</p>

<a name="registration"></a>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>
    Registration for the 2007 TopCoder Open Studio Design Competition will open at 9:00 AM EST on Monday, February 19,
    2007, and will close at 6:00 PM EDT on Monday, April 30, 2007. In order to be eligible to compete in the Studio
    Design Competition of the TCO, competitors must be a registered TopCoder member and have registered separately for
    the Studio Design Competition. There is no limit to the number of registrants for the tournament; however each
    individual may only register once.
</p>

<a name="placement"></a>

<h2>Placement Scoring</h2>

<p>
    Studio contests that are eligible for points towards the tournament will be identified as an SDC contest on the
    Studio website starting March 5, 2007. Scoring in the SDC is determined by the placement of the top four (4)
    submissions for each eligible contest. Placement of the top four (4) submissions for a TCO contest is determined
    based on the same criteria Studio contests have always followed, which could be one of, or a combination of, the
    following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Client chooses the winner at their discretion with no community involvement</li>
    <li>Client asks finalists to revise designs, then chooses winner with no community involvement</li>
    <li>Client selects finalists, which are put out to a community vote to determine a winner</li>
    <li>All contests submissions are put out to a community vote to determine a winner</li>
</ul>

<p>
    You must be registered for the SDC to be eligible for tournament placement points. Placement scoring is as follows:
</p>

<div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 300px;"><strong>
    1st Place - 10 Points<br>
    2nd Place - 7 Points<br>
    3rd Place - 5 points<br>
    4th Place - 4 Points<br>
    Below 4th Place - 0 Points
</strong>
</div>


<p>
    The placement points outlined are for all Studio contests that are part of the online SDC competition round.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Open Competition Explanation</b>

<p>
    Both Studio members who have not registered for the TCO and TCO registered members will be allowed to enter any
    Studio design contest, including SDC TCO contests. Because of the mixed competitor pool, it is possible that TCO
    registered members may not place in the top four (4) of any given contest. If the situation arises, there will be no
    placement points awarded to TCO registered members who did not place in the top four (4).

    <a name="scoring"></a>

    <h2>Scoring and Advancing </h2>

    <p>
        During the eight (8) weeks of online competition, eligible competitors can submit designs for as many contests
        as they like. Submissions will be screened against the Spec Doc by the Contest Administrator and either passed
        or failed depending on whether all of the requirements of the Spec Doc are met. Competitors can resubmit any
        fixes to their failed designs before the submission deadline. ALL SUBMISSIONS MUST BE RECEIVED ACCORDING TO THE
        SUBMISSION DEADLINE TO BE CONSIDERED A VIABLE ENTRY. THERE WILL BE NO EXCEPTIONS. There will be no elimination
        of contestants during the online competition.
    </p>

    <p>
        After the submission phase for a contest is over, placements will be determined.
    </p>

    <p>
        Up to the six (6) highest individual placement scores that each contestant receives for his/her submissions
        throughout the eight (8) weeks of competition will be added together for a cumulative placement score. Up to
        eight (8) competitors with the highest cumulative positive (i.e., greater than zero) placement score will
        advance to the onsite Championship round.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Example:</b><br>
        Contestant enters three TCO eligible Studio design contests during the online competition, earning the following
        placement scores:
    </p>

    <p>
        Contest #1 - placement 2; placement score 7<br>
        Contest #2 - placement 3; placement score 5<br>
        Contest #3 - placement 3; placement score 5 <br>
        <br><br>
        Cumulative placement score: 7 + 5 + 5 = 17
    </p>

    <p>
        In the event of a tie of cumulative placement score among the advancers to the Championship round, the tie will
        be resolved in the following manner:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The competitor who has the most higher-placed submissions among those submissions used to develop the
            cumulative placement score for the tied contestants shall advance.
        </li>
        <li>If a tie still remains, then the tied contestants will enter into a Rapid Design Contest (see below) and the
            winner shall advance.
        </li>
        <li>If a tie still remains, then all tied contestants will advance to the onsite Championship round.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The Rapid Design Contest will only include the competitors who are tied as stated above. This contest will
        consist of designing a mock (graphical representation) of a fictitious web site's main page. The tied finalists
        will only be allowed to submit one design for this contest. The designs must pass the normal Studio screening
        process to be accepted. Once submissions are received, they will be presented to the community for a vote. The
        winner of the Rapid Design contest will be chosen based on who wins the community vote. The winner will advance
        to the onsite finals. <b>The results of the vote and choice of the winner are final.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        The schedule for the Rapid Design contest is as follows:
    </p>
    Submission Phase: May 1 - May 4, 2007<br>
    Voting Phase: May 7 - May 11, 2007<br>
    Winner Announced: May 11, 2007
</p>

<h2>Onsite Championship Round</h2>

<h3>Important Information</h3>

<p>
    <b>Travel Confirmation</b><br>
    Up to eight (8) advancers from the eight (8) weeks of online competition will travel to the Mirage on Tuesday, June
    26, 2007 to compete in the final competitive stage of the tournament being held on Thursday, June 28, 2007. All
    contestants must arrive at the Mirage no later than 4:00 PM PDT on Tuesday, June 26, 2007.
</p>

<p>
    All contestants must confirm their attendance at the onsite rounds no later than 5:00 PM EDT (UTC/GMT -4) on Friday,
    May 11, 2007. That is, contestants must have acquired any necessary travel visas and know for certain that they can
    travel to the U.S. by that date and time. In order for a finalist to confirm attendance for the onsite finals, it is
    necessary to show proof of visa and/or passport by the deadline (5:00 PM EDT (UTC/GMT -4) on Friday, May 11, 2007)
    if the finalist is required to travel from outside the United States. Finalists may do this by emailing a copy of
    their documents to Jessie D'Amato Ford at <a href="mailto:jford@topcoder.com">jford@topcoder.com</a>. Competitors who fail to meet this requirement by the
    deadline will not be able to attend the onsite finals and will be replaced as an onsite finalist.
</p>
<b>Visa Assistance</b><br>
TopCoder will issue visa invitation letters at the request of international competitors who require one to obtain a
travel visa to enter the United States. All competitors who pass screening on at least two designs will receive a
request form to fill out if they require a letter. As soon as a competitor fills out the form in its entirety, their
letter will be shipped out by FedEx International Priority mail. Competitors have until 5:00 PM EDT (GMT/UTC -4) on
Monday, April 23, 2007 to request a letter. Visas can take a significant amount of time to obtain in certain countries;
therefore, for those competitors who need a letter, it is in their best interest to request one well before the
deadline. The cost of obtaining a visa is the sole responsibility of the competitor. If you fail to request a visa
invitation letter by the date above, TopCoder will not assist you in the process of obtaining a travel visa. See more
information about <A href="/tc?module=Static&d1=tournaments&d2=tco07&d3=getVisa">travel visas</A>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Travel Details</b><br>
    TopCoder will provide air travel arrangements for each competitor. The flight reserved by and paid for by TopCoder
    is for arrival on June 26, 2007 and departure on June 30, 2007 (or July 1, 2007 if the cost is significantly less to
    fly out a day later). TopCoder will pay for each competitor's airfare up to $1,500, however we will do what we
    believe is reasonable given each individual circumstance (e.g., if the most reasonably convenient ticket itinerary
    is a little more than $1,500, TopCoder will pay for the entire cost). Extended flights and/or hotel room nights
    requested by a competitor that result in additional costs will be the responsibility of the competitor and will be
    deducted from the competitor's total TCO prize money won.
</p>

<p>
    TopCoder will also provide ground transportation to and from the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, as
    well as hotel accommodations and meals for each contestant. All other expenses are the responsibility of the
    contestant.
</p>

<p>
    TopCoder will not provide travel or lodging accommodations for competitor guests at the 2007 TCO.
</p>

<h2>Onsite Championship Round</h2>

<p>
    Each finalist will compete on the same design challenge, which will be announced on Tuesday, June 26, 2007 during
    the Welcome Reception. Finalists will receive an overview packet at the Welcome Reception describing their
    challenge, which begins Thursday, June 28, 2007 at 9:00 AM PDT in the Competition Arena.
</p>

<p>
    Finalists will have one (1) day to compete and submit their final design. During the competition, finalists will
    also have a brief public feedback period with the judges. Judges will give the finalists their initial impressions
    of each design. Finalists will have time to incorporate this feedback into their design as they work toward
    finalizing their submission.
</p>

<p>
    Finalists must use the workstation provided by TopCoder Studio during the competition. This workstation will contain
    the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A PC running Windows XP</li>
    <li>Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop installed</li>
    <li>The open-source graphic programs GIMP and InkScape</li>
    <li>A sketchpad, pencils and pencil sharpener</li>
    <li>Limited Internet access to the following sites only:
        <ul>
            <li>iStockPhoto.com: Each finalist will have an account with $20 credit available for stock photos</li>
            <li>ColorBlender.com</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Finalists may bring the following:
<ul>
    <li>Their own keyboard</li>
    <li>Up to two (2) design reference books, such as color guides, typography references, etc. However, template books
        (or books containing any template ideas) may NOT be used.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Competitors may not bring any other materials (including flash disks, magazines, or sketches). Keyboards must be
    given to the technical team at least one (1) hour before the competition begins and reference materials must be
    evaluated by TopCoder at least 30 minutes before the competition begins. TopCoder reserves the right, at any point
    in the onsite competition, to confiscate any reference materials it deems inappropriate for any reason whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
    The winner of the 2007 TopCoder Open SDC will be determined at the judges' discretion.
</p>

<a name="prizes"></a>

<h2>About the Prizes</h2>

<p>
    All contestants who submit designs that pass screening for at least two (2) TCO design contests during the online
    competition will receive a prize. The tournament will award $30,000 in cash prizes. Any and all applicable taxes on
    prizes are the sole responsibility of the prizewinner.

    As a condition of winning and redeeming a cash prize, certain contestants will be required to submit a completed (i)
    Competitor Questionnaire, (ii) Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release, (iii) IRS Form W-9 or
    W-8BEN, as appropriate if one is not already on file with TopCoder, and (iv) Travel Form. In completing the
    Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release, a cash prize winner (a) confirms his/her eligibility,
    (b) represents and warrants that he/she has not cheated; that the idea for the code and/or challenge submitted is
    his/hers alone, (c) verifies the accuracy of the demographic information submitted to, and contained in, the
    TopCoder member database, (d) authorizes TopCoder to publicize the tournament's results, (e) agrees to sign any
    applicable forms required by tax authorities, (f) licenses to TopCoder rights to all information submitted during
    the tournament (including rights to source code and other executables), and (g) releases TopCoder from liability
    arising out of any prize won. TopCoder requires contestants to complete the Form W-9 or W-8BEN for tax reporting
    purposes. If prize notification is returned as undeliverable, or if the cash prize winner fails to return the
    Questionnaire, Affidavit, W-9 or W-8BEN, or travel form, as specified, the cash prize winner will be disqualified
    and the prize money won by the disqualified cash prize winner will be forfeited. Providing false information in the
    registration process or in the required forms described in this paragraph will disqualify a cash prize winner.
