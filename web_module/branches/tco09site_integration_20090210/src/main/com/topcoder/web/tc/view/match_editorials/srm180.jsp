<p>
Three-dimensional geometry is poison to some. It was balm for <b>tjq</b>,
who solved all three Division One problems in little more than an hour
to win the latest single-round match. Hot on his heels came <b>haha</b>,
finishing a fraction of a point behind. "To compute the distance between
a line segment and a point in space is child's play," said the top two in
a fictitious post-match interview. "You just derive a whatsit and squeeze
it through a thingummybob." <b>Klinck</b>, who had won third place, chimed
in, "Then you twiddle the didgeridoo, and you're done!" So it's that easy.
</p>

<p>
In Division Two, coders recoiled from the geometric overtones of the
hard problem like vampires from a garlic plantation. It was either that
or the funky recursion, but not one correct submission came in. Even
so, <b>python55</b> had cause to celebrate after his eighteenth
competition, winning the division and finally earning a ticket to
the major league. Also enduring the pain were <b>dontian</b> and
<b>sean_henderson</b>, who both came within thirty points of first place.

Dinky fish breed with clockwork regularity: at the end of every month,
each male-female couple produces a pair of offspring, one of each
sex. Given the current population of a fish tank and the tank capacity
in liters, we are to calculate the number of months that elapse before
there is fewer than half a liter per dinky fish.

</p><p>

Since the greatest allowable capacity is one million liters and
the fish population doubles every month, the tank will soon become
crowded. Simulation is recommended for a system of such brief
duration. One way to simulate the monthly population increase is to
write a loop, but I prefer recursion, where one writes a function that
calls itself. This is an especially convenient approach in cases where
the state of a system in the current time-step is defined as a function
of its state in the previous time-step.

</p><p>

The key observation here is that the number of couples is the lesser
of the number of males and the number of females. This number, in turn,
is exactly the size of the population increase in males and in females.

</p><pre>

def dinky(capacity, male, female):
   if (male+female > 2*capacity):
      return 0
   if (female &lt; male):
      inc = female
   else:
      inc = male
   return 1 + dinky(capacity, male+inc, female+inc)

</pre><p>

To avoid dealing with floating-point numbers, we double the tank capacity
and then pretend that each dinky fish requires a full liter.

Given a corpus of spam messages, we are to determine whether at least
75% of the token set derived from a fresh email message appears in the
spam corpus. There are two hurdles to clear in this problem. First,
we must extract tokens from an email message, and second, we must treat
the resulting tokens as a set with unique members.

</p><p>

Many languages, including Java, offer powerful libraries that will
accomplish both tasks with a line or two, leaving little more than a
pair of nested loops to code. If we have access to high-level parsing
and hashing functions, a solution looks something like the following.

</p>
<pre>
def filter(spam, mail):
   spam_hash = {}
   for message in spam:
      for tok in re.findall("[a-zA-Z]+", message.lower()):
         spam_hash[tok] = 1
   ret = []
   for i in range(len(mail)):
      message_hash = {}
      ct = 0
      for tok in re.findall("[a-zA-Z]+", mail[i].lower()):
         if (not message_hash.has_key(tok) and spam_hash.has_key(tok)):
            ct = ct+1
         message_hash[tok] = 1
      if (4*ct/3 >= len(message_hash.keys())):
         for tok in message_hash.keys():
            spam_hash[tok] = 1
      else:
         ret.append(i)
   return ret
</pre>
<p>

Notice that we can use an integer calculation to determine whether the
75% threshold has been met. We must not neglect to render messages in
lowercase or to expand the set of spam tokens whenever a new piece of
spam is identified.
</p><p>

Programmers who don't have a regular-expression engine on hand can write
their own tokenizing function.

</p>
<pre>
def tokenize(message):
   ret = []
   tok = ""
   for c in message:
      if (c in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"):
         tok = tok+c
      else:
         if (tok != ""):
            ret.append(tok)
         tok = ""
   if (tok != ""):
      ret.append(tok)
   return ret
</pre>

There is still some cheating going on, since the conditional expression

<p>
<pre>
      if (c in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"):
</pre>

uses a high-level function to check for membership of a character in a
string. The same can be accomplished by means of a loop.
</p>

<pre>
      alpha = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
      found = 0
      for i in range(52):
         if (alpha[i] == c):
            found = 1
      if (found == 1):
</pre>
<p>

The presence of a token in a token set can be determined in like
fashion. Instead of a hash, then, we can use an ordinary list and a
single loop.

<p>

Given three consecutive readings from a radar installation that plots the
locations of flying objects once per second, we are asked to consider
the possibility that every object is traveling in a fixed direction
at constant speed. If the data unambiguously lead to this conclusion,
we are to calculate the speed of each object.

</p><p>

Since the readings are taken at one-second intervals, the speed of an
object is trivially obtained from the distance between two consecutive
radar-blip locations. What is less trivial to determine is which radar
blips are, in fact, consecutive readings of the same object. Let us
begin by computing the distance and direction&#151;or, equivalently, the
displacement vector&#151;between a point from the first interval and a
point from the second. The displacement vector from point <i>(x0,y0)</i>
to point <i>(x1,y1)</i> is <i>(x1-x0,y1-y0)</i>.

</p><p>

Now consider the displacement vector from the second point to some point
in the third interval. If the two displacement vectors are identical,
then the three points potentially belong to an object traveling in
a straight line at constant speed. It is also possible that we have
inferred a pattern where there is none, since the points may belong to
different objects. We can, nonetheless, assume for the time being that
we have identified a single object traveling in the desired fashion, and
we proceed to look for further equalities between displacement vectors
that span (a) the first and second readings and (b) the second and third
readings while (c) hinging on the same point in the middle.

</p><p>

If we are able to find as many pairs of matching displacement vectors
as there are points in each time interval, then we have found
an interpretation that agrees with the premise of straight-line,
constant-speed motion for every object. Then again, it is possible
that there are several such interpretations. We should therefore
store the speeds we have calculated for the present interpretation,
keeping them as potential return values, and backtrack to search for
other interpretations. What we are doing, in sum, is a depth-first
recursion through all possible matchings of displacement vectors. A Java
implementation follows.

</p>
<pre>
int n, ct = 0, speeds[], x1[], y1[], x2[], y2[], x3[], y3[], ret[];
boolean used1[], used2[];

void doit(int pos) {
   if (pos == n) {
      ct++;
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
         ret[i] = speeds[i];
      return;
   }
   int i, j, dx, dy, speed;
   for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
      if (used1[i])
         continue;
      dx = x2[i]-x1[pos];
      dy = y2[i]-y1[pos];
      speed = (int) Math.round(Math.sqrt(dx*dx+dy*dy));
      used1[i] = true;
      for (j = 0; j &lt; n; j++)
         if (!used2[j] &amp;&amp; x3[j]-x2[i] == dx &amp;&amp; y3[j]-y2[i] == dy) {
            used2[j] = true;
            speeds[pos] = speed;
            doit(pos+1);
            used2[j] = false;
         }
      used1[i] = false;
   }
}

public int[] deduceSpeeds(int[] x1, int[] y1, int[] x2, int[] y2, int[] x3, int[] y3) {
   this.x1 = x1; this.y1 = y1;
   this.x2 = x2; this.y2 = y2;
   this.x3 = x3; this.y3 = y3;
   n = x1.length;
   speeds = new int[n];
   ret = new int[n];
   used1 = new boolean[n];
   used2 = new boolean[n];
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
      used1[i] = used2[i] = false;
   doit(0);
   if (ct == 1)
      return ret;
   return new int[0];
}
</pre>
<p>

Much of this code is devoted to setting up global variables. Note that
<i>speeds</i> is used to store a partial result, while <i>ret</i> stores
a full result to be returned if it turns out to be the only one. Each
time a full matching is found, we increment the counter <i>ct</i> and
copy the contents of <i>speeds</i> into <i>ret</i>.

</p><p>

The arrays vital to carrying out the recursive search are <i>used1</i>
and <i>used2</i>. Observe that in each one, the boolean value at the
appropriate index is set to <i>true</i> before making a recursive call,
then reset to <i>false</i> afterward. They record our tentative decisions
as we continue to search through the space of all matchings, so that
we don't allocate the same points to different vectors. They serve,
in effect, to lock pairs of displacement vectors on a temporary basis
during our search for a full interpretation. Understand this, and you
understand all.

This problem concerns a grille superimposed on a square of text with each
cell covering one character. The grille has had one quarter of its cells
punched out to form a pattern of holes such that after three 90-degree
rotations of the grille, every character will have appeared through a hole
exactly once. Given a partial grille, we are to complete it if possible,
punching new holes as necessary in the upper-left quadrant.

</p><p>

Consider a cell at some location in the upper-left quadrant of the
grille. To what three locations besides this one can it be rotated? In a
complete and valid coding grille, there must be a hole at exactly one of
the four total possible locations. If, upon inspection, we find that more
than one of the four cells has been punched out, the grille is invalid. If
they are all intact, we punch out only the one in the upper-left quadrant.

</p><p>

The crux of the matter, then, is to determine how the coordinates of a
hole change when the grille undergoes a 90-degree rotation.

</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="/i/srm/srm180_1.png" border="0"/>
</p>

<p>

We can determine by trial and error that in an <i>n</i>-by-<i>n</i>
grid, a cell at location <i>(i,j)</i> is rotated to <i>(j,n-1-i)</i>.

</p>
<pre>
def square(grille):
   n = len(grille)
   for i in range(n/2):
      for j in range(n/2):
         ct = 0
         ii = i
         jj = j
         for k in range(4):
            if (grille[ii][jj] == '.'):
               ct = ct+1
            tt = ii
            ii = jj
            jj = n-1-tt
         if (ct > 1):
            return []
         if (ct == 0):
            grille[i] = grille[i][:j]+"."+grille[i][j+1:]
   return grille
</pre>
<p>

In languages where strings are immutable, the contents of <i>grille</i>
cannot be directly altered one cell at a time. Instead, an entire row must
be written over with a new string that incorporates slices of the old one.

Given the latitude, longitude, and altitude of some satellites and
rockets, we are asked to determine which rockets are visible to at least
three satellites. Since the line of sight between a satellite and a rocket
can be occluded only by the Earth, the problem boils down to deciding
whether a line segment intersects with a sphere. Conscientious coders
who, unlike me, always paid attention in math class and know their way
around a cross product should be able to solve this problem by applying
the right formulas. Those of us who aren't equipped with a sophisticated
mathematical toolkit need not despair, for we can make do with a bit of
visual imagination and a smattering of trigonometry.

</p><p>

The first item on the agenda is to transform the input into a more useful
form. Once the location of each rocket and satellite has been rendered
in Cartesian coordinates, we'll be able to calculate distances using the
familiar Pythagorean Theorem. The diagram below shows a sphere of radius
<i>r</i> tilted slightly down and to the right. The equator and latitude
zero are drawn in pink. To the west of latitude zero and north of the
equator is a blue dot lying on the surface of the sphere at latitude
<i>a</i> and longitude <i>b</i>.

</p><p>

Imagine that the center of the sphere is at the origin of a coordinate
system whose <i>x</i> axis runs through the equator at the 90-degree
longitude, while the <i>y</i> axis runs through the northern pole. The
<i>z</i> axis runs through the equator at zero longitude, projecting
out of the computer screen and toward your mouse (if you're right-handed).

<p>

Notice how altitude <i>a</i> defines a plane that cuts through
the <i>y</i> axis at the <i>y</i> coordinate of the blue dot. The
equator, or latitude zero, lies in the plane where <i>y</i> is always
zero. To find the distance between these parallel planes, we examine
the right triangle formed by projecting a radius at angle <i>a</i>
onto the <i>y</i>=0 plane. This triangle is shown at the right of the
diagram. Opposite the angle of measure <i>a</i> is a leg of length
<i>r</i>sin<i>a</i>, giving the <i>y</i> coordinate of our dot.

</p><p>

The other leg, having length <i>r</i>cos<i>a</i>, spans
the distance between the <i>y</i> axis and the surface of the sphere
at latitude <i>a</i>. This is also the measure of the hypotenuse of
an interesting right triangle. Observe that longitude zero lies in the
plane where <i>x</i> is always zero. If we draw the shortest line from
the blue dot to this plane, its length is the <i>x</i> coordinate of the
dot. Similarly, the <i>z</i> coordinate is equal to the length of the
shortest line from the dot to the plane where <i>z</i>=0. These two lines
are perpendicular and lie in the plane of altitude <i>a</i>.  By sliding
the <i>z</i>-coordinate line toward the east, we form a right triangle,
as pictured to the left of the sphere. For the purpose of illustration,
it has been tilted forward into the plane of the computer screen.

</p><p>

The degree of longitude of the dot, namely <i>b</i>, gives us an
acute angle of the triangle. We already know that the length of the
hypotenuse is <i>r</i>cos<i>a</i>. Thus, from the basic
trigonometric relations, we deduce that the <i>x</i> coordinate is
<i>r</i>cos<i>a</i>sin<i>b</i> and the <i>z</i>
coordinate is <i>r</i>cos<i>a</i>cos<i>b</i>. What
if we are interested in the Cartesian coordinates of a point lying not on
the surface of the sphere, but at a positive altitude? Then we imagine a
larger sphere such that the point in question does lie on its surface. The
same conversion formulas apply, only with a different <i>r</i> value.

</p><p>

Now that we possess the mojo to calculate Cartesian coordinates for the
point corresponding to every satellite and rocket, let's see what we
can do with these points. Consider the line segment stretching between
a satellite and a rocket. On it is one point that lies closer than any
other to the center of the earth. If and only if this point is below the
surface of the earth, there is no line of sight between the rocket and
the satellite. If we had some way to calculate the distance between the
center of the earth and this point, we could compare it with the radius
of the earth to make our decision. Bear in mind that we are modeling
the earth as a sphere centered at the origin of the coordinate system.

<p>
The heavy-duty geometric approach is to draw a line through the satellite
and rocket, compute its distance from the origin, and then check for cases
where the closest point on the line falls outside the line segment. But
the 3D line-point distance calculation is somewhat esoteric, and anyway
there is no need for exact methods when a problem calls for absolute
precision of 1e-6. There happens to be a concise numerical method that
does not concern itself with any special case.
</p
><p>
Let the center of the earth be the apex of a triangle whose base is the
line segment between the rocket and the satellite. In searching for the
point on the triangle base nearest the origin, let us suppose that the
rocket is farther than the satellite from the origin. It is then useful
to see that the midpoint of the base is closer than the rocket to the
origin, but still far enough that the closest point lies between it and
the satellite. We can therefore restrict our search to that half of the
base lying between the midpoint and the satellite. The diagram below
shows why this is true.
</p>
<p>
<center>
<img src="/i/srm/srm180_4.png" border="0"/>
</center>
</p>
<p>
If the height of the triangle is incident on its base, then the midpoint
must fall between the height and the rocket, or else the rocket wouldn't
be farther than the satellite. Observe that the height bisects a smaller
triangle formed by horizontally reflecting the leg that ends in the
satellite. If, on the other hand, the height falls outside the base,
then the closest point to the apex is in fact the satellite, so it can't
hurt to halve the distance to it.
</p>
<p>
The converse arguments apply if it is not the satellite but the rocket
that lies nearer the origin. In either case, we can construct a triangle
with the same apex and the same height as the original but with a base
only half as wide, having the pleasing property that it includes the
closest point to the apex. We can carry out further iterations of the
procedure, always choosing that half of the base lying between the
midpoint and the shorter leg, until we are arbitrarily close to the
true answer.
</p>
<p>
Once we have computed the distance between the origin and every line
segment formed by a satellite and a rocket, we know which rockets are
visible to which satellites, and it remains only to tally the number
of satellites per rocket. Below are the essential parts of a Java
implementation, starting with a function that converts from spherical
to Cartesian coordinates.
</p>

<pre>
double[] sph2car(double altitude, double latitude, double longitude) {
   double[] ret = new double[3];
   ret[0] = altitude * Math.cos(latitude) * Math.sin(longitude);
   ret[1] = altitude * Math.sin(latitude);
   ret[2] = altitude * Math.cos(latitude) * Math.cos(longitude);
   return ret;
}
</pre>

<p>
We shall make use of a utility function that copies one 3D coordinate
to another.
</p>

<pre>
void p2p(double[] pFrom, double[] pTo) {
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)
      pTo[i] = pFrom[i];
}
</pre>

<p>
In the following loop, <i>rocs</i> and <i>sats</i> are the arrays in which
we have stored the Cartesian coordinates of the rockets and satellites,
respectively.
</p>

<pre>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; rocs.length; i++) {
   for (int j = 0; j &lt; sats.length; j++) {
      double r[] = new double[3], s[] = new double[3];
      double dr, ds;
      p2p(rocs[i], r);
      p2p(sats[j], s);
      while (true) {
         dr = Math.sqrt(r[0]*r[0]+r[1]*r[1]+r[2]*r[2]);
         ds = Math.sqrt(s[0]*s[0]+s[1]*s[1]+s[2]*s[2]);
         if (Math.abs(dr-ds) &lt; 1e-6)
            break;
         double[] m = {(r[0]+s[0])/2, (r[1]+s[1])/2, (r[2]+s[2])/2};
         if (dr &gt; ds)
            p2p(m, r);
         else
            p2p(m, s);
      }
      dist[i][j] = dr;
   }
}
</pre>

<p>
Thus, having made use of little specialized knowledge but much insight,
we tame a three-dimensional geometry problem with a humble binary search.
