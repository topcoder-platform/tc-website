The winner of each region will be crowned the Regional Champion, win $5,000 and automatically advance to the final field of 16 competitors.  This elite 16 will compete in the tournament's final two onsite rounds and vie for their share of $150,000.  The Semifinal and Championship rounds will be held April 19 and 20, 2002 at the University Park Hotel @ MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  There, the tournament champion will win $100,000.</P>
