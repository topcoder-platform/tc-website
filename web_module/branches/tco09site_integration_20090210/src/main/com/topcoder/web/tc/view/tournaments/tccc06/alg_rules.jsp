The format for each Qualification Round will be the same as all other tournament rounds, which is outlined in the <LINK>Competition Round Structure</LINK> section.
<br><br>
Members will be rated at the conclusion of their qualification attempt based on their performance against others competing in the same round.  All qualifiers will be assigned tournament seeds based on their Algorithm rating following the Qualification Rounds.
<br><br>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the Qualification Round, the tie will be resolved in the following manner: 
<ul>
<li>By rating (higher is better) prior to the Qualification Round.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to Online Round #1.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<a href="#top"><img src="/i/tournament/tccc06/back_to_top.gif" alt="back to top" width="83" height="23" border="0" align="right"></a>
<a name="structure"></a>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Online Elimination Rounds</span><br><br>
Everyone who competes in an online round must register for each round in the TopCoder Competition Arena no later than five (5) minutes prior to the start of the online round.  TopCoder members from around the world may be participating in the online rounds, but all start times will be communicated as Eastern Daylight Time (GMT -4), so contestants in different time zones must adjust accordingly. If a coder does not participate, for any reason, in an online round he/she has advanced to, it will be treated as an automatic loss in that round of competition. 
<br><br>
All competitors who have qualified for an online round will indicate the section of the round in which they wish to compete.  Competitors will indicate their choice during tournament registration and the choice relates to both Online Rounds #1 and #2.  TopCoder will fill the sections for Online Rounds #1 and #2 based on indicated preference by member rating (i.e., higher rated members are given preference over lower rated members).
<br><br>
All competitors in a specific section will be assigned to rooms based on 'dartboard seeding' (completely random). Rooms will be created such that each room has a maximum of 25 competitors. The number of rooms in each round is (maximum # advancers in the round)/25.

<span class="bodySubtitle">Scoring and Advancing during Online Rounds</span><br>
After each section of competition in Online Rounds #1 and #2, the highest scorers from across all rooms in the section will be identified and will advance to the next online round.  Coder advancement in all rounds is determined by comparing the total point values from all three phases of the round for each coder. In order to advance, a coder must finish each round with a positive (i.e., greater-than-zero) point total. The structure of the online rounds is as follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>Online Round #1</strong><br>Up to 600 coders will compete in each section and up to 150 will advance from each section.  The highest 150 scorers across all rooms in each section will advance to Online Round #2.</li>
<li><strong>Online Round #2</strong><br>Up to 150 coders will compete in each section and up to 50 will advance from each section.  The highest 50 scorers across all rooms in each section will advance to Online Round #3.</li>
<li><strong>Online Round #3</strong><br>Up to 150 coders will compete and up to 48 will advance.  The highest 48 scorers across all rooms will advance to the field of Semifinalists.</li>
</ul>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> In the event of a tie for any advancing position during the online rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner:
<ul>
<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during the rounds of the tournament in which all of the tied participants were presented with the same set of problems (excluding the Qualification Round).</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then by tournament seed.</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, all tied coders will advance to the next round.</li>
</ul>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Round Structure</span><br>
Each online and onsite round of competition (including the Qualification Rounds) consists of three phases: Coding Phase, Challenge Phase, and System Testing Phase. (Note: The format of these competition rounds is similar to the format of TopCoder Single Round Matches.  The rules in place for Single Round Matches as of September 7, 2006 will also apply to the online and onsite rounds of the TCCC, with the exception of the Unused Code Rule during the onsite rounds.)
<ul>
<li><strong>The Coding Phase</strong> is a timed event where all contestants are presented with the same three questions representing three levels of complexity and, accordingly, three levels of point earnings potential. Points for a problem are awarded upon submission of any solution that successfully compiles and are calculated on the total time elapsed from the time the problem was opened until the time it was submitted.  During the online rounds, the Coding Phase will last 75 minutes.  During the onsite rounds, the Coding Phase will last 85 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenge Phase</strong> is a timed event wherein each competitor has a chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors' code. A successful challenge will result in a loss of the original problem submission points by the defendant, and a 50-point reward for the challenger.  Unsuccessful challengers will incur a point reduction of 25 points as a penalty, applied against their total score in that round of competition.  During the online rounds, the Challenge Phase will last 15 minutes.  During the onsite round, the Challenge Phase will last 10 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>The System Testing Phase</strong> is applied to all submitted code that has not already been successfully challenged. If the TopCoder System Test finds code that is flawed, the author of that code submission will lose all of the points that were originally earned for that code submission. The automated tester will apply a set of inputs, expecting the output from the code submission to be correct. If the output from a coder's submission does not match the expected output, the submission is considered flawed. The same set of input/output test cases will be applied to all code submissions for a given problem. All successful challenges from the Challenge Phase will be added to the sets of inputs for the System Testing Phase.</li>
</ul>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Onsite Semifinal and Championship Rounds</span><br>
The forty-eight (48) advancers from Online Round #3 will travel to the San Diego Marriott Mission Valley on Tuesday, November 14, 2006 to compete in the Semifinal rounds of the tournament being held on Wednesday, November 15 and Thursday, November 16, 2006.  All contestants must arrive at the San Diego Marriott Mission Valley no later than 4:00 PM PST on Tuesday, November 14, 2006.  All contestants must confirm their attendance at the onsite rounds no later than 8:00 AM EDT (GMT -4) on Wednesday, October 18, 2006.  That is, contestants must have acquired any necessary travel visas and know for certain that they can travel to the U.S. by that date and time.  If a contestant is unable to attend the onsite rounds, he/she will forfeit his/her eligibility to receive any prizes awarded to onsite finalists, and his/her spot in the tournament will be given to the next highest overall scorer from Online Round #3.  
<br><br>
At the end of the Qualification Rounds, TopCoder will issue letters at the request of international competitors who require one to obtain a travel visa to enter the United States.  Visa letters can be requested by emailing Jessie D'Amato Ford at <A href="mailto:jdamato@topcoder.com">jdamato@topcoder.com</A> and must be requested by Thursday, October 12, 2006 at 5:00 PM EDT (GMT -4).  Visas can take a significant amount of time to obtain in certain countries; therefore, for those competitors who need a letter, it is in their best interest to request one well before the deadline.  The cost of obtaining a visa is the sole responsibility of the competitor.
<br><br>
TopCoder will provide air travel arrangements for each competitor. The flight reserved by and paid for by TopCoder is for arrival on November 14, 2006 and departure on November 18, 2006. Extended flights and/or hotel room nights requested by a competitor that result in additional costs will be the responsibility of the competitor and will be deducted from the competitor's total TCCC prize money won.
<br><br>
TopCoder will also provide ground transportation to and from the San Diego airport, as well as hotel accommodations and certain meals for each contestant.  All other expenses are the responsibility of the contestant.  TopCoder will not provide travel or lodging accommodations for competitor guests at the 2006 TCCC.  
<br><br>
TopCoder will determine the room assignments for the Semifinal rooms prior to the start of each Semifinal round, in a manner such that the average competitor rating following Online Round #3 for each room will be similar.  The dates and times of the onsite Semifinal, Wildcard and Championship Rounds are as follows:

<br><br>   
<strong>The Semifinal Round</strong> will consist of three (3) rooms of sixteen (16) coders each. The two (2) highest scorers in each room will advance to the Championship Round. The next four (4) highest scorers in each room will participate in one (1) Wildcard Round. The two (2) highest scorers of the Wildcard Round will also advance to the Championship Round.
<br><br>
<strong>The Championship Round</strong> will be a single round of eight (8) coders. Placement in the Championship Round is determined by comparing the total points of each coder. The winner of the Championship Round will be the coder with the highest point total for the round. In the event of a tie in the Semifinal, Wildcard and/or Championship Rounds, the tie will be resolved in the following manner (in order):

<ul>
<li>Total points acquired (higher is better) during Online Rounds #1, #2 and #3 of the 2006 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge</li>
<li>If a tie still remains, then by rating (higher is better) following Online Round #3</li>
   <ul>
   <li>If a tie still remains in the Semifinal or Wildcard Rounds, then all tied coders will advance to the Championship Round</li>
   <li>If a tie still remains in the Championship Round, then the prize money will be distributed equally among the tied coders</li>
