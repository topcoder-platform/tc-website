						Massaro: Whiz cracks contest code<BR/><BR/>
						LAFAYETTE -- Daniel Wright is thinking ahead. Here, in the midst of the holiday season, he's looking forward to spring.<BR/><BR/>
						Don't think he's a grouch who sucks lemons instead of Christmas punch. He's going to spend the holidays at home. And he's going to be busy.<BR/><BR/>
						"I won't have any free time this winter break," he said. "I'll probably be working on an honors thesis."<BR/><BR/>
						Wright, 20, is studying computer science at Stanford University. He's pretty much a whiz. He finished second in the TopCoder national computer contest last month. Competitors solve complicated math problems. They were definitely not the kind of stuff you could solve with a hand-held calculator.<BR/><BR/>
						Going in, Wright was the favorite to win.<BR/><BR/>
						But his mind got to drifting when it should have been drafting. So he settled for second-best money of $25,000.<BR/><BR/>
						He had placed second in a previous contest in June.<BR/><BR/>
						"It was just lack of concentration," he said. "I had that in mind the whole time in this round. I didn't want to repeat that."<BR/><BR/>
						He did.<BR/><BR/>
						Wright is a native of South Africa. He moved to Boulder County with his family in December 1998.<BR/><BR/>
						"We moved out of the hot summer into a lot of snow," he said.<BR/><BR/>
						That's because Johannesburg is south of the equator, so seasons are reversed.<BR/><BR/>
						"It gets cold in winter. It just doesn't snow," he said. "We once had sleet when I was 7."<BR/><BR/>
						Wright's interest in computers goes "way, way back," he said. "My parents were both computer programmers. We had a computer in the house basically since I was in kindergarten. They taught me how to write some very simple programs. Then gave me a book. I've been programming since first or second grade."<BR/><BR/>
						He said he may become a professor, or go into research. Whatever, computers will be the root of his career.<BR/><BR/>
						Side note to Daniel's family: Don't expect any neat gifts for Christmas.<BR/><BR/>
						"I decided that whatever I won, I would put in safe deposit for three months -- just so I didn't do anything rash," he said. "I just don't want to throw it away very quickly. I'll probably have a nice spring break."<BR/><BR/>
