<p><strong>Glastonbury, CT - October 1, 2009</strong> - NVIDIA Corporation and TopCoder, Inc., today announced the winners of the first CUDA Superhero Challenge at NVIDIA's GPU Technology Conference. The Challenge series of challenges asks computer programmers to harness the parallel processing power of the NVIDIA(R) CUDA(TM) architecture to solve some of computing's biggest challenges. First place prize went to Micha Riser, of Zurich, Switzerland who earned a $2,500 prize for his winning solution, closely followed by runner up Hou Qiming of Beijing, China, who won $1,000 for his submission.</p>

<p>"I started exploring CUDA only in the second week of the contest. I had heard of it before but never got the chance to try it out myself," said Riser, a software engineer at carrara engineering GmbH, Switzerland. "The challenge was very fun, and I learned much about the CUDA framework and the computation power of the NVIDIA graphic cards as well as about the CCL problem and different ways to solve it."</p>

<p>This first Challenge in the series of challenges ran Sept. 14th through Sept. 25th, and centered on image processing using GPU accelerated connected component labeling (CCL). One of the most common processing steps in applications such as real time object recognition, machine vision and many others, CCL is a simple but computationally intensive process. A series of high resolution images were provided and competitors were challenged to identify all objects and areas consisting of groups of adjacent pixels of the same color within a specified threshold, with submitted implementations scored on the basis of correctness and total overall performance.</p>

<p>"We were able to enlighten 1000s of developers on the advantages parallel programming offers," said Sanford Russell, general manager of the CUDA group at NVIDIA." When talented developers see the ease and performance advantages of co-processing with the NVIDIA CUDA architecture first-hand, they understand the excitement behind the GPU Computing revolution."</p>
