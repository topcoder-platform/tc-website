<span class="bodySubTitle"><em>Coding and Component Tournament Winners Take Home $100,000</em></span></p>
</div>

<p><strong>BOSTON, MA., April 19, 2004&#151;</strong>
TopCoder, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, skills assessment and competitive software development, today announced that Tomasz Czajka of Warsaw, Poland, Pavlo Aksonov of the Ukraine and Roman Koshlyak, also of the Ukraine, have won the Coding, Design and Development Component tournaments of the 2004 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge sponsored by Yahoo!, held at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel &amp; Towers in Boston, MA on April 16th. Czajka beat 23 of the world's top computer programmers during the onsite semifinal and Championship rounds for the $25,000 grand prize in the Coding tournament.  Aksonov and Koshlyak took home $25,000 and $15,000 respectively as the Design and Development winners in the Component tournament. 
</p>
<p>
The Coding tournament was a timed competition where the participants solved complex algorithmic problems using Java, .Net, C++ or C#.  The Component tournament was focused on software design and development where the participants in each tournament were provided general requirements and asked to design or develop re-useable software components.   
</p>
<p>
At the start of the Coding tournament, Czajka, known by the handle 'tomek', was the Number 1 seed and the Number 1 rated member among more than 38,000 members worldwide. Czajka's winning strategy of a measured approach to the problems combined with a limited challenge phase paid off well as he recorded a final score of 417.22, beating out second place finisher Ben Wilhelm of Seattle, WA, US with 397.16 points, and second runner up John Dethridge of Melbourne, Australia and fourth place finalist Reid Barton, of Arlington, MA, US. As a result of his victory, Czajka remains the Number 1 rated TopCoder member. The finalists earned a spot at the event by besting almost 1,000 other programmers from around the world in simultaneous, online competitions.  
</p>
<p>
"It was a hard fought victory and the competition was strong," said Czajka. "I have a great deal of respect for the other finalists and look forward to the next competition!" 
</p>
<p>
Aksonov and Koshlyak battled to win their challenges in Design and Development respectively. After the results were announced, Aksonov said he was excited to be put to the test by such a collection of coding talent. Koshlyak intends to use part of his prize to start his own software company.
</p>
<p>
"Yahoo! salutes each and every competitor who made this event such a great success," said Libby Sartain, Senior Vice President, Human Resources and Chief People Yahoo, "Their passion, creativity and ability to perform in a challenging arena is a great credit to them all."
