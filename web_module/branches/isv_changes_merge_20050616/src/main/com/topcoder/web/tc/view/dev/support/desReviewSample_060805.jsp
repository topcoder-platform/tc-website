design addresses all the requirements as specified in the requirements
documents and the forum. The reviewer should be able to take each point
in the requirements document and find the associated implementation in
the design. The reviewer should ignore the quality aspects of the
implementation at this point, and only verify whether a requirement is
addressed or not. Other questions of the scorecard give you an
opportunity to express your concerns about the quality of the design.
The reviewer should read the component forum prior to doing this to
ensure that any modifications or additions to the requirements are
taken into account. </p><p class="scorecardQuestion">
</p><p class="scorecardQuestion">&#8216;Core&#8217; requirements will be defined as
those requirements that are essential to component&#8217;s intent (i.e. the
component either cannot fulfill its goal or cannot provide value added
service to the customer without those requirements). </p><p class="scorecardQuestion">
</p><p class="scorecardQuestion">Rating 1 &#8211; The design is missing any
of the &#8216;core&#8217; requirements. The missing requirement(s) prevent the

problem for which the component was requested, but is missing major
usability features from the requirements document.

of the &#8216;core&#8217; requirements and a majority of the &#8216;non-core&#8217;
requirements and, potentially, includes minor additional functionality.
The design solves the problem for which the component was requested,
provides all the usability features, but either does not provide
enhancements on top of the requirements, or the added functionality
does not alter the customer&#8217;s experience with the component.

<p class="scorecardQuestion">The use cases cover all the business requirements as stated in the requirements document.</p>

<p class="scorecardQuestion">The reviewer should be able to take each requirement and find a use case covering it (a single use case may cover multiple requirements). Use cases must not be too high-level or too low-level. Additional functionality beyond the requirements must be covered by use cases as well.</p>

<p class="scorecardQuestion">These rules should be considered when judging the use cases:</p>

<p class="scorecardQuestion">a) A use case is something an actor wants the system to do</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">b) Use cases are always started by an actor</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">c) Use cases are always defined from the point of view of an actor</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">d) Use cases are always described by a verb phrase</p>

<p class="scorecardQuestion">When a single use case covers multiple unrelated activities, it is considered too high-level. A good indicator of this is a single use case covering multiple points in the requirements document.</p>

<p class="scorecardQuestion">Too low-level is defined as multiple use cases covering related activities. For example, providing a use case for each constructor or each version of an overloaded method are considered too low-level.</p>

<p class="scorecardQuestion">Use cases must not reveal the intended implementation. For example, a use case of "Read Configuration" should not specify how it reads the configuration (i.e. it should not say "Read Configuration via Configuration Manager," unless the component provides other user-selectable alternatives for obtaining the configuration without the Configuration Manager).</p>

<p class="scorecardQuestion">This question does not address the presentation of the diagrams; only the logical content needs to be considered.</p>

<p class="scorecardQuestion">Rating 1 - A majority (> 49%) of the requirements are not covered by the use cases. </p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">Rating 2 - A majority (> 49%) of the requirements are covered but at least one requirement is missing and/or the use cases are too high (or low) level in detail as explained above.</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">Rating 3 - All the requirements are covered at a proper level of detail as explained above. </p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">Rating 4 - All the requirements are covered at a proper level of detail as explained above, and the designer made proper use of inherited/associations/extend/include semantics.</p>

understanding in the implementation of it. A pattern/methodology should
have been used but was not (name the missing patterns and explain how

design. The reviewer should not be critical of the designer's use,
assumptions or lack of details for components that are being proposed
in the design or are currently in the design/development stage - as

</p><p class="scorecardQuestion">Have internally used classes (to the
component) been defined incorrectly as public? Has a public class
improperly exposed protected or private members? Are abstract classes
abstract? It is strongly advised that variables have a private scope
(not even protected) and only be accessible via getter/setter methods
(exception would be C#'s property variables). C# reviewers should note
that Poseidon does not have the proper choices to fully represent the
C# modifiers and therefore should not be marked down if the designer
either uses the closest java modifier OR specifies it in the
documentation tab. Additionally, the effect of the final, virtual and
other similar modifiers on class extendibility should be considered in
this question (rather than the future enhancements question).
</p><p class="scorecardQuestion">
</p><p class="scorecardQuestion">This question addresses the logical
aspect of providing the modifiers, not the presentation of it. When
there are multiple ways to convey a modifier, not using all of them is
considered a presentation issue. For example, an abstract class must
have an abstract checkbox on the attributes page, an abstract
stereotype, and a color of the abstract class. Any of the three methods
is sufficient to convey that the class is abstract for the purposes of
this question.

obvious lack of understanding or ignores modifiers fully. For example,
variables with accessor methods are declared public, or key methods of

The answers to the questions should be limited to how well the design
was documented. This largely means how easy will it be to take the
design and develop it. Please note that the reviewer should assign a 4
if any section is not applicable to the design. Reviewers should
disregard whether the designer used HTML tags, properly line wrapped or
even if the document is not well formed (ie HTML errors) in the
documentation tab(s). The documentation is for the developer only and
will not be used for presentation purposes. </strong>

<p class="scorecardQuestion">The method documentation in the 'Documentation' tab of Poseidon provides detailed description of the method's scope, parameters (including what is considered valid or not), return type (range, nulls, etc.) and any exceptions that may be thrown. Properties, delegates, indexers and events of C# are considered methods for the purpose of this question.</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">This documentation is for the component developer, not the component users. It is not javadoc on how to use the method. It should contain helpful information to the developer on how to write the method and what are its constraints. Examples of argument values are not required. The designer does not have to explicitly say what is considered valid if this information is already contained elsewhere (in the tags or in the free-form text). Duplicating the valid/invalid information and exception information in both the documentation tags and free form text is not required (nor even recommended). Algorithms and complex validation (such as with a regex pattern) should be explained only in the free form text. The reviewer should assume that any variable (null, empty string, int range, etc) is valid/invalid if not specifically denoted as an invalid/valid by the exceptions text or other free form information. Also note that specifying 'raised signals in Poseidon is not required if the exception has been clearly denoted in the documentation tags or free form text.</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">For C# designs, the reviewer should verify that property setters handle argument validation and throw appropriate exceptions.</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">Rating 1 - Documentation is consistently missing or unhelpful. </p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">Rating 2 - Documentation is missing in at least one method documentation or consistently provides little help to the developer. </p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">Rating 3 - Documentation is complete and adequate to develop the component but requires the designer to answer additional questions by the developer. </p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">Rating 4 - Documentation is complete and provides full details to the developer (the developer will likely not require any additional information from the designer).</p>

<p class="scorecardQuestion">The component specification contains a comprehensive demo section.</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">Is the demo section complete? Was it written to promote the component to potential users?</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">The demo section is not a reference implementation or a set of unit tests. It should give the reader a quick, concise demonstration of the major functionality of the component. "Major functionality" is defined as the requirements specified in the requirements documentation.</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">The demo section needs to compile only with respect to the components API. All other elements (application provided methods, classes, objects, etc.) shown can be assumed if commented properly and, may include pseudocode. Examples of this would be:</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">
a) ACMEInterface appACME = application provided object<br>
b) Date todayPlusOne = todays date plus 1 day
</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">The 'compilability requirement should be lenient on well-formed source code (i.e. missing semi-colons, non-closed parens/quotes, etc. do not count). It is the developers responsibility to correct the demo to ensure well formedness.</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">External setup information does not need to be included in the demo as long as comments provide enough information to understand what setup the demo relied on.</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">Only the relevant output of the demo needs to be shown (i.e. when the components job is to output something specific). Logging output does not need to be shown.</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">Rating 1 - Demo section is missing or the existing demo section contains non-compilable errors (don't actually try to compile it - just view it to make sure it looks correct). </p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">Rating 2 - The demo section demonstrates some but not all of the requirements or the demo section demonstrates class/methods/variables that don't exist in the design (probably were never updated).</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">Rating 3 - The demo section demonstrates each of the requirements correctly.</p>
<p class="scorecardQuestion">Rating 4 - The demo section demonstrates each of the requirements correctly in a clear fashion using a likely customer scenario (i.e. sets up a scenario that is similar to what a user of the component would see) or demonstrates extra functionality or flexibility.</p>

</p><p class="scorecardQuestion">
</p><p class="scorecardQuestion">Did the designer make use of fonts and
colors to appropriately denote elements in the diagrams? Was the
specification formatted in a professional looking manner? Was the
diagram laid out in an easy to follow manner (most important elements
in the top left to least important at the right and bottom edges)? Were
like items grouped together (i.e. implementations [including the
abstract base] of some interface should be near the interface)? Did the
layout help you understand the design? Note: multiple class diagrams
are allowed but discouraged unless separate sub-packages were used or
the design was sufficiently complex that multiple diagrams help in the
understanding.
