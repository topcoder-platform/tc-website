            <h2>Official Rules &amp; Regulations</h2>
            <p>NO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN, VOID WHERE PROHIBITED. Registration and participation by developers in the ESPN Winning Formula Competition (the "Competition") constitutes agreement with these terms and conditions ("Rules" or "Terms and Conditions") between you and TopCoder, Inc. ("TopCoder").</p>
            
            <h2>About the Competition</h2>
            <h3>Entering the Competition</h3>
            <p>This skill-based Competition is brought to you and sponsored by TopCoder, Inc.  This Competition is designed to encourage the development and use of certain technologies, and provides an opportunity for members of the TopCoder Community to create software that can predict future events based on past events.</p>
            <p>In order to participate in the ESPN Winning Formula Marathon Match Competition (the "Competition"), you must agree to be bound by these Official Rules &amp; Regulations ("Rules") and to all decisions of TopCoder, which are final, binding and conclusive in all matters.  Participants must be registered members of TopCoder, and also register for the Competition.  Each TopCoder member who has registered for the Competition ("Competitor") will be given access to the problem statement for the Competition and the competition data ("Historical Data").</p>
            <p>Registration may occur at any time from 11:59 AM EDT on July 28, 2008 through 2:00PM EDT on Sept. 24, 2008.  The Competition will begin at 11:59 AM EDT on July 28, 2008 and will end at 12:01AM EDT on Dec. 11, 2008.</p>
            
            <h3>Upon Entering a Marathon Match</h3>
            <p>All Competitors registered for the Competition will see a Submit option. Clicking the Submit link will take the Competitor to a page that will allow the Competitor to paste in a solution, select the proper language and either submit (for compilation and testing) or save your code. When the Submit button is selected, the code will be immediately compiled. Any compilation messages or errors will be shown in the Messages Area. If the compilation was successful, the submission will then be placed on a queue for automated testing ("Submission").  Competitors may submit multiple Submissions during a Submission Phase (but only once every 4 hours), however only the most recent Submission will be used to determine the Competitor's score for that phase.  If a Competitor has a pending submission on the testing queue it must finish testing before the Competitor may submit another submission.</p>
            <p>TopCoder reserves the right to limit the participation of any person in the Competition, amend or interpret these Rules and Regulations or official communications governing the Competition or cancel the Competition for any reason with prior notice. Notices for any such amendment, interpretation or cancellation will be deemed to have been given by posting on the TopCoder website and by virtue of a Competitor's continued participation in the Competition. A Competitor may terminate participation in the Competition upon written notice to TopCoder.</p>
