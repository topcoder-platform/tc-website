<span class="bodySubTitle"><em>20 of the World's Best Programmers Will Vie for $130,000 Prize Purse at the 2003 TopCoder Open, Sponsored by Intel&#174;</em></span></p>
</div>

<p><strong>GLASTONBURY, Conn., November 12, 2003&#151;</strong>
TopCoder, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, skills assessment and competitive software development, today announced the 20 finalists who have advanced to the final rounds of the 2003 TopCoder Open, sponsored by Intel&#174; (www.topcoder.com/tco).  This third annual tournament, open to professional and collegiate programmers worldwide, will award cash prizes totaling $130,000.  The tournament's Semifinal and Championship Rounds will be held December 4th and 5th at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, CT.</p>

<p>"As a world-wide technology leader, Intel is pleased to be involved with these champions of software development," said Monique Torres, Intel&#174; Developer Services Campaigns and Promotions Manager.  "TopCoder has provided the track on which these champions race."</p>

<p>The onsite events of the TopCoder Open will include the culmination of two programming tournaments.  Throughout the day on Dec. 4th, 16 competitors will compete in four Semifinal rounds of the "Coding Tournament."  The Coding Tournament is a timed competition where the participants solve complex algorithmic problems using Java, C++, C# or VB.Net.  The winner of each Semifinal round will advance to the Championship round on Dec. 5th.  The winner of the Coding Tournament will receive $50,000.</p>

<p>The "Component Tournament" finals, first tournament of its kind, will also be held on Dec. 5th.  The Component Tournament is a more traditional competition where four participants are provided general requirements and are asked to design and develop re-useable software components.  Competitors choose to compete in either the Design or the Development track, and a winner will be selected in each area.  Each of these winners will receive $10,000.</p>

<p>The "Sweet 16" field of the Coding Tournament, plus two replacements, is comprised of the following programmers:</p>
