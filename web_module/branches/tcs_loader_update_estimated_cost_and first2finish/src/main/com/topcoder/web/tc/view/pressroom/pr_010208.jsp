<strong>GLASTONBURY, CONN., January 2, 2008 &#151;</strong>TopCoder&#174;, Inc., the leader in online programming competition, skills assessment and competitive software development, has relocated to new office space after a year of unprecedented fast growth. TopCoder is always looking for the best talent, both locally and globally, and required a larger office space to accommodate recent growth and continued expansion for 2008 and beyond. TopCoder remains headquartered in Glastonbury, Conn., now located at 95 Glastonbury Blvd.
</p>

<p>
TopCoder's growth continued at a record pace in 2007, as was recognized with a ranking of No. 45 in the Inc. 500 list of America's fastest-growing private companies (The 2007 Inc. 500 can be found in Inc. magazine's September issue, with TopCoder ranked No. 45 based upon three-year sales growth of 2,459.4%). Yet the biggest highlight of TopCoder's growth lies in its member base, which topped 135,000 members in 2007. TopCoder's active online community is made up of ranked and rated software designers and developers from nearly every nation in the world-competing and collaborating to produce software faster and of higher quality through a unique business model that has shaken up the business community.
</p>

<p>
"Our Glastonbury location is only the physical footprint of what we believe is becoming one of the most dynamic and significant virtual organizations in the world," said Jack Hughes, chairman and founder of TopCoder, Inc. "Our staff numbers are increasing to support our fast growing base of community members and client list.  We couldn't be happier in Connecticut.  We have access to great talent, great natural resources from the ocean to the mountains and easy access to all of the northeast major metro areas and the rest of the world when we need it - all in an affordable package that benefits our business operations and employees."
</p>

<p>
The new office location provides TopCoder with more than 11,000 square feet of space, and includes plenty of room for growth as the company looks to continue adding top talent on the hiring front. The new office provides a significantly greater presence for the company, located in a new professional development park just outside of Hartford, Conn.
