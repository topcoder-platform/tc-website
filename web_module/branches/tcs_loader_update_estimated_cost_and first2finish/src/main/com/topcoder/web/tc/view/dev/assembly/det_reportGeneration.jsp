<span class="bigTitle">Report Generation</span>
<br><br>
<div class="sectionHeader">Overview</div>
<span class="bodySubtitle">Application Overview</span><br>
Report Generation is part of a larger application known as Instrumentation Reporting.   The purpose of report generation is to help users identify positive or negative trend and performance statistics relating to key resources across a web farm.  A key resource can be classified as a component, web method, machine name, user id, client application, or client location.  These inputs will be supplied by a user to produce reports.
<br><br>
There are two general types of reports in the application:
<ol>
<li>Graph Reports - these reports are generated from rolled up statistics tables, and rendered as appropriate graphs.</li>
<li>Tabular Reports - these reports are generated from the raw data and are rendered as tables.</li>
</ol>

Report Generation will be used by a TopCoder client. All application documentation (including an assembly guide) will be available once registered. 
<br><br>
<span class="bigRed">NOTE: Please see the eligibility requirements below. Competitors must sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and pass a background check before being admitted into this competition.   If you have previously completed these documents, no further action is needed.  The background check process may take up to 2 weeks which could affect your participation in this competition.  However, once you are cleared, you will be able to compete in future competitions that impose this restriction.

<span class="bodySubtitle">Competition Overview</span><br>
This assembly competition will consist of component integration and extensive unit testing to ensure correct operation.  The majority of the application will be implemented by generic TopCoder components.  The main task will involve <b>configuring these components, writing UI code, writing unit tests</b>, and <b>providing directions for configuration within the larger application</b>.  These directions must identify any configurations that are necessary to run your solution.  
<ul>
<li>An html prototype will be provided to you. You should use these pages for the intended functionality.</li>
<li>A sample database will be provided containing data to produce each report.</li>
</ul>
