Because we value privacy as much as we value programmers, TopCoder is committed to protecting the privacy of our users.  
We want to provide a safe, secure user experience.  We will use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that the information 
you submit to us remains private.
Your personal information is immediately transfered from our web server to behind our firewall, where it remains isolated 
from a direct connection to the Internet.
The information that you submit to us is used only for the purposes as set forth herein, as required by law, or when we believe 
in good faith that disclosure is legally required to protect our rights.  The following reflects our commitment to you.

                                    <BR/>
                                    <B>Information About All TopCoder Visitors</B>
                                    <BR/>
We gather information about all of our users collectively, including (a) what area users visit most frequently, (b) their 
Internet domain and their computer's IP address, (c) the type of browser and operating system they use and (d) if the user 
linked to our Web site from another Web site, the address of that other Web site.  This information does not in any way personally 
identify a user; we only use this data anonymously and in the aggregate.  We use this information to analyze trends and statistics 
to help us improve our services, plan site enhancements and measure overall site effectiveness.  From time to time we may reveal 
general, anonymous, aggregated statistical information about our site, services and users, such as the number of visits and users 
and what site features they use.

If you choose to register as a member in order to participate in TopCoder tournaments, you will provide us with additional 
information about yourself, including name and address  If you are a winner, we will also request your date of birth.
In addition, if you are a U.S. person (including U.S resident aliens), we will request your social security number 
(or taxpayer identification number) on IRS form W-9.  If you are a winner, and you are not a U.S person, we will request a 
Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding on IRS form W-8BEN.  
We use this information to 
verify your eligibility to participate in specific tournaments, and to contact you and properly notify the IRS should you be 
a winner.  From time to time, we may use the contact information to alert members of new competitions and communicate news, 
events and reminders.  If you do not want to be alerted of any of these items, do not check the "Contest Notification" box 
on the registration form.  
During competition, users participating will be shown and identified only by their handles.  
A TopCoder member's handle, rating, date registered, winnings to date, skill set, and personal quote will be publicly available to any participants 
of the TopCoder web site and competition applications.
Spectators are allowed to view the competition 
without identifying themselves, but competition participants must be members and must login to prove it.  All source code created during 
the competition will be available to anyone - spectators, members and sponsors and may be subject to challenge from other members.  
Your performance in a competition will allow us to help balance the competition.  It will be recorded to calculate competition rating 
values and it will be posted on the web site and in the competition area.  Winners' names may also be released to 
governmental authorities as required by law and to those requesting such information from TopCoder.  At registration, we will ask you 
to answer questions regarding certain demographic information as it relates to your status as a student or a professional.
<BR/>

relevant technology skills.  You have the ability to update and change this information at any time and we encourage you to keep it 
updated.<BR/>

<BR/>
TopCoder sponsors may contact you proactively based upon your skills, experience and TopCoder success.  TopCoder may decide to  
utilize a process through which TopCoder members may choose to review online inquiries from interested TopCoder sponsors 
or subscribing companies before being contacted by those companies.
