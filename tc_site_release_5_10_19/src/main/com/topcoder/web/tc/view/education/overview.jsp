August's "Coders of the Month" include an Italian designer, a Chinese algorithm competitor, and a developer from Bosnia &amp;  Herzegovina.  In this article, we ask them for their advice to newbies, the accomplishments that they're most proud of, and the things that stress them out.</li>

The situation: The boss has just returned from a technology conference, no doubt full of torturous new ideas. You perspire in your seat, waiting for the inevitable conversation.
